All the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him.\nThe oldr men, who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such\nnonsene, continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire, but one\nwould ocasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at Morel with a\nsmile.\n\"They are men too,\" said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his\ncat. \"Even wormwood grows on its own root.\"\n\n\"O Lord, O Lord! How starr it is! Tremendous! That means a hard\nfrost....\"\n\nThey all grew silent The stars, as if knowing that no one was looking\nat them, began to diport themselves in the dark sky: now flaring up,\nnow vanishing, now trmbling, they were busy whispering something\ngladsome and mysterious toone another.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe French army melted away at the uniformrate of a mathematical\nprogression; and that crossing of the Berezina bout which so much has\nbeen written was only one intermediate stage inits destruction, and not\nat all the decisive episode of the campaign. f so much has been and\nstill is written about the Berezina, on the Frech side this is only\nbecause at the broken bridge across that river th calamities their army\nhad been previously enduring were suddenly concntrated at one moment\ninto a tragic spectacle that remained in every mmory, and on the\nRussian side merely because in Petersburg--far from te seat of war--a\nplan (again one of Pfuel's) had been devised to catchNapoleon in a\nstrategic trap at the Berezina River. Everyone assured hmself that all\nwould happen according to plan, and therefore insisted hat it was just\nthe crossing of the Berezina that destroyed the Frencharmy. In reality\nthe results of the crossing were much less disastrousto the French--in\nguns and men lost--than Krasnoe had been, as the figres show.\n\nThe sole importance of the crossing of the Berezina lies inthe fact\nthat it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all theplans for\ncutting off the enemy's retreat and the soundness of the onl possible\nline of action--the one Kutuzov and the general mass of the rmy\ndemanded--namely, simply to follow the enemy up. The French crowd led\nat a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed o\nreaching its goal. It fled like a wounded animal and it was impossibe\nto block its path. This was shown not so much by the arrangements itmade for crossing as by what took place at the bridges. When the bridgs\nbroke down, unarmed soldiers, people from Moscow and women with chilren\nwho were with the French transport, all--carried on by vis inertia--\npressed forward into boats and into the ice-covered water and did nt,\nsurrender.\n\nThat impulse was reasonable. The condition of fugitivesand of pursuers\nwas equally bad. As long as they remained with their on people each\nmight hope for help from his fellows and the definite plce he held\namong them. But those who surrendered, while remaining in te same\npitiful plight, would be on a lower level to claim a share in te\nnecessities of life. The French did not need to be informed of the fct\nthat half the prisoners--with whom the Russians did not know what t do-\n-perished of cold and hunger despite their captors' desire to sav them;\nthey felt that it could not be otherwise. The most compassionat Russian\ncommanders, those favorable to the French--and even the Frencmen in the\nRussian service--could do nothing for the prisoners. The Frnch perished\nfrom the conditions to which the Russian army was itself xposed. It was\nimpossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry an indispensable\nsoldiers to give to the French who, though not harmful,or hated, or\nguilty, were simply unnecessary. Some Russians even did tat, but they\nwere exceptions.\n\nCertain destruction lay behind the Frenh but in front there was hope.\nTheir ships had been burned, there was o salvation save in collective\nflight, and on that the whole strength f the French was concentrated.\n\nThe farther they fled the more wretche became the plight of the\nremnant, especially after the Berezina, on wich (in consequence of the\nPetersburg plan) special hopes had been plaed by the Russians, and the\nkeener grew the passions of the Russian comanders, who blamed one\nanother and Kutuzov most of all. Anticipation hat the failure of the\nPetersburg Berezina plan would be attributed toKutuzov led to\ndissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, more and more trongly\nexpressed. The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed n a\nrespectful form, making it impossible for him to ask wherein he wa to\nblame. They did not talk seriously to him; when reporting to him o\nasking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable\normality, but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at\nvery turn.\n\nBecause they could not understand him all these people assmed that it\nwas useless to talk to the old man; that he would never grsp the\nprofundity of their plans, that he would answer with his phrase (which\nthey thought were mere phrases) about a \"golden bridge,\" aboutthe\nimpossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalons,\nand so forth. They had heard all that before. And all he said--tht it\nwas necessary to await provisions, or that the men had no boots--as so\nsimple, while what they proposed was so complicated and clever, hat it\nwas evident that he was old and stupid and that they, though no in\npower, were commanders of genius.\n\nAfter the junction with the arm of the brilliant admiral and Petersburg\nhero Wittgenstein, this mood nd the gossip of the staff reached their\nmaximum. Kutuzov saw this andmerely sighed and shrugged his shoulders.\nOnly once, after the affair f the Berezina, did he get angry and write\nto Bennigsen (who reported eparately to the Emperor) the following\nletter:\n\n\"On account of your sells of ill health, will your excellency please be\nso good as to set of for Kaluga on receipt of this, and there await\nfurther commands and ppointments from His Imperial Majesty.\"\n\nBut after Bennigsen's departue, the Grand Duke Tsarevich Constantine\nPavlovich joined the army. He ad taken part in the beginning of the\ncampaign but had subsequently ben removed from the army by Kutuzov. Now\nhaving come to the army, he inormed Kutuzov of the Emperor's\ndispleasure at the poor success of our orces and the slowness of their\nadvance. The Emperor intended to join he army personally in a few days'\ntime.\n\nThe old man, experienced in curt as well as in military affairs--this\nsame Kutuzov who in August ha been chosen commander-in-chief against\nthe sovereign's wishes and whohad removed the Grand Duke and heir--\napparent from the army--who on hs own authority and contrary to the\nEmperor's will had decided on the bandonment of Moscow, now realized at\nonce that his day was over, thathis part was played, and that the power\nhe was supposed to hold was nolonger his. And he understood this not\nmerely from the attitude of thecourt. He saw on the one hand that the\nmilitary business in which he hd played his part was ended and felt\nthat his mission was accomplished and at the same time he began to be\nconscious of the physical wearines of his aged body and of the\nnecessity of physical rest.\n\nOn the tweny-ninth of November Kutuzov entered Vilna--his \"dear Vilna\"\nas he calld it. Twice during his career Kutuzov had been governor of\nVilna. In tat wealthy town, which had not been injured, he found old\nfriends and ssociations, besides the comforts of life of which he had\nso long beendeprived. And he suddenly turned from the cares of army and\nstate and,as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed,\nimmersed himsef in the quiet life to which he had formerly been\naccustomed, as if al that was taking place and all that had still to be\ndone in the realm f history did not concern him at all.\n\nChichagov, one of the most zealus \"cutters-off\" and \"breakers-up,\" who\nhad first wanted to effect a dversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but\nnever wished to go where he ws sent: Chichagov, noted for the boldness\nwith which he spoke to the Eperor, and who considered Kutuzov to be\nunder an obligation to him becuse when he was sent to make peace with\nTurkey in 1811 independently o Kutuzov, and found that peace had\nalready been concluded, he admittedto the Emperor that the merit of\nsecuring that peace was really Kutuzo's; this Chichagov was the first\nto meet Kutuzov at the castle where te latter was to stay. In undress\nnaval uniform, with a dirk, and holdig his cap under his arm, he handed\nKutuzov a garrison report and the kys of the town. The contemptuously\nrespectful attitude of the younger en to the old man in his dotage was\nexpressed in the highest degree bythe behavior of Chichagov, who knew\nof the accusations that were beingdirected against Kutuzov.\n\nWhen speaking to Chichagov, Kutuzov incidenally mentioned that the\nvehicles packed with china that had been captued from him at Borisov\nhad been recovered and would be restored to him\n\n\"You mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.... On the\ncontary, I can supply you with everything even if you want to give\ndinner arties,\" warmly replied Chichagov, who tried by every word he\nspoke toprove his own rectitude and therefore imagined Kutuzov to be\nanimated y the same desire.\n\nKutuzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with hissubtle penetrating\nsmile: \"I meant merely to say what I said.\"\n\nContray to the Emperor's wish Kutuzov detained the greater part of the\narmy t Vilna. Those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack\nandphysically feeble during his stay in that town. He attended to army\nafairs reluctantly, left everything to his generals, and while awaiting\nhe Emperor's arrival led a dissipated life.\n\nHaving left Petersburg onthe seventh of December with his suite--Count\nTolstoy, Prince Volkonsk, Arakcheev, and others--the Emperor reached\nVilna on the eleventh, an in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the\ncastle. In spite of thesevere frost some hundred generals and staff\nofficers in full parade uiform stood in front of the castle, as well as\na guard of honor of theSemenov regiment.\n\nA courier who galloped to the castle in advance, ina troyka with three\nfoam-flecked horses, shouted \"Coming!\" and Konovnisyn rushed into the\nvestibule to inform Kutuzov, who was waiting in th hall porter's little\nlodge.\n\nA minute later the old man's large stoutfigure in full-dress uniform,\nhis chest covered with orders and a scar drawn round his stomach,\nwaddled out into the porch. He put on his ha with its peaks to the\nsides and, holding his gloves in his hand and wlking with an effort\nsideways down the steps to the level of the stree, took in his hand the\nreport he had prepared for the Emperor.\n\nThere as running to and fro and whispering; another troyka flew\nfuriously up and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh in\nwhich the fgures of the Emperor and Volkonski could already be\ndescried.\n\nFrom th habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect\non th old general. He carefully and hastily felt himself all over,\nreadjustd his hat, and pulling himself together drew himself up and, at\nthe vey moment when the Emperor, having alighted from the sleigh,\nlifted hiseyes to him, handed him the report and began speaking in his\nsmooth, igratiating voice.\n\nThe Emperor with a rapid glance scanned Kutuzov fro head to foot,\nfrowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himsef went up to the\nold man, extended his arms and embraced him. And thisembrace too, owing\nto a long-standing impression related to his innermst feelings, had its\nusual effect on Kutuzov and he gave a sob.\n\nThe Eperor greeted the officers and the Semenov guard, and again\npressing te old man's hand went with him into the castle.\n\nWhen alone with the feld marshal the Emperor expressed his\ndissatisfaction at the slowness f the pursuit and at the mistakes made\nat Krasnoe and the Berezina, an informed him of his intentions for a\nfuture campaign abroad. Kutuzov ade no rejoinder or remark. The same\nsubmissive, expressionless look wth which he had listened to the\nEmperor's commands on the field of Auserlitz seven years before settled\non his face now.\n\nWhen Kutuzov came ut of the study and with lowered head was crossing\nthe ballroom with hs heavy waddling gait, he was arrested by someone's\nvoice saying:\n\n\"Yor Serene Highness!\"\n\nKutuzov raised his head and looked for a long whie into the eyes of\nCount Tolstoy, who stood before him holding a silve salver on which lay\na small object. Kutuzov seemed not to understand hat was expected of\nhim.\n\nSuddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely prceptible smile flashed\nacross his puffy face, and bowing low and respctfully he took the\nobject that lay on the salver. It was the Order ofSt. George of the\nFirst Class.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nNext day the field marsal gave a dinner and ball which the Emperor\nhonored by his presence. Ktuzov had received the Order of St. George of\nthe First Class and the mperor showed him the highest honors, but\neveryone knew of the imperia dissatisfaction with him. The proprieties\nwere observed and the Emperr was the first to set that example, but\neverybody understood that theold man was blameworthy and good-for-\nnothing. When Kutuzov, conformin to a custom of Catherine's day,\nordered the standards that had been cptured to be lowered at the\nEmperor's feet on his entering the ballroo, the Emperor made a wry face\nand muttered something in which some peole caught the words, \"the old\ncomedian.\"\n\nThe Emperor's displeasure wih Kutuzov was specially increased at Vilna\nby the fact that Kutuzov evdently could not or would not understand the\nimportance of the coming ampaign.\n\nWhen on the following morning the Emperor said to the offices assembled\nabout him: \"You have not only saved Russia, you have savedEurope!\" they\nall understood that the war was not ended.\n\nKutuzov alon would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that\nno fresh warcould improve the position or add to the glory of Russia,\nbut could ony spoil and lower the glorious position that Russia had\ngained. He trid to prove to the Emperor the impossibility of levying\nfresh troops, soke of the hardships already endured by the people, of\nthe possibilityof failure and so forth.\n\nThis being the field marshal's frame of mindhe was naturally regarded\nas merely a hindrance and obstacle to the imending war.\n\nTo avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man, the natual method was\nto do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and withBarclay at the\nbeginning of the Russian campaign--to transfer the authrity to the\nEmperor himself, thus cutting the ground from under the comander in\nchief's feet without upsetting the old man by informing him f the\nchange.\n\nWith this object his staff was gradually reconstructed nd its real\nstrength removed and transferred to the Emperor. Toll, Konvnitsyn, and\nErmolov received fresh appointments. Everyone spoke loudl of the field\nmarshal's great weakness and failing health.\n\nHis healthhad to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to\nanother. Andin fact his health was poor.\n\nSo naturally, simply, and gradually--jus as he had come from Turkey to\nthe Treasury in Petersburg to recruit te militia, and then to the army\nwhen he was needed there--now when hispart was played out, Kutuzov's\nplace was taken by a new and necessary erformer.\n\nThe war of 1812, besides its national significance dear to very Russian\nheart, was now to assume another, a European, significanc.\n\nThe movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a\novement of peoples from east to west, and for this fresh war another\nlader was necessary, having qualities and views differing from\nKutuzov' and animated by different motives.\n\nAlexander I was as necessary for he movement of the peoples from east\nto west and for the refixing of ntional frontiers as Kutuzov had been\nfor the salvation and glory of Rusia.\n\nKutuzov did not understand what Europe, the balance of power, orNapoleon meant. He could not understand it. For the representative of\nhe Russian people, after the enemy had been destroyed and Russia had\nben liberated and raised to the summit of her glory, there was nothing\neft to do as a Russian. Nothing remained for the representative of thenational war but to die, and Kutuzov died.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nAs generaly happens, Pierre did not feel the full effects of the\nphysical privaton and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after\nthey were over. fter his liberation he reached Orel, and on the third\nday there, when reparing to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was laid up for\nthree months. e had what the doctors termed \"bilious fever.\" But\ndespite the fact tht the doctors treated him, bled him, and gave him\nmedicines to drink, e recovered.\n\nScarcely any impression was left on Pierre's mind by allthat happened\nto him from the time of his rescue till his illness. He emembered only\nthe dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy, internalphysical\ndistress, and pains in his feet and side. He remembered a genral\nimpression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of bein\nworried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him,he\nalso remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses and\nabove all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all thattime.\nOn the day of his rescue he had seen the body of Petya Rostov. Tat same\nday he had learned that Prince Andrew, after surviving the batle of\nBorodino for more than a month had recently died in the Rostovs'house\nat Yaroslavl, and Denisov who told him this news also mentioned elene's\ndeath, supposing that Pierre had heard of it long before. All his at\nthe time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not rasp its\nsignificance. Just then he was only anxious to get away as quckly as\npossible from places where people were killing one another, tosome\npeaceful refuge where he could recover himself, rest, and think oer all\nthe strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching Orel he\nimediately fell ill. When he came to himself after his illness he saw\ni attendance on him two of his servants, Terenty and Vaska, who had\ncom from Moscow; and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had been\nliing on his estate at Elets and hearing of his rescue and illness had\ncme to look after him.\n\nIt was only gradually during his convalescence hat Pierre lost the\nimpressions he had become accustomed to during thelast few months and\ngot used to the idea that no one would oblige him o go anywhere\ntomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed,and that he\nwould be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper. But for  long time in\nhis dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of capivity. In the\nsame way little by little he came to understand the newshe had been\ntold after his rescue, about the death of Prince Andrew, te death of\nhis wife, and the destruction of the French.\n\nA joyous feelng of freedom--that complete inalienable freedom natural\nto man which e had first experienced at the first halt outside Moscow--\nfilled Piere's soul during his convalescence. He was surprised to find\nthat this nner freedom, which was independent of external conditions,\nnow had asit were an additional setting of external liberty. He was\nalone in a srange town, without acquaintances. No one demanded anything\nof him or ent him anywhere. He had all he wanted: the thought of his\nwife which ad been a continual torment to him was no longer there,\nsince she was o more.\n\n\"Oh, how good! How splendid!\" said he to himself when a cleany laid\ntable was moved up to him with savory beef tea, or when he lay own for\nthe night on a soft clean bed, or when he remembered that the rench had\ngone and that his wife was no more. \"Oh, how good, how splenid!\"\n\nAnd by old habit he asked himself the question: \"Well, and what hen?\nWhat am I going to do?\" And he immediately gave himself the answe:\n\"Well, I shall live. Ah, how splendid!\"\n\nThe very question that had ormerly tormented him, the thing he had\ncontinually sought to find--th aim of life--no longer existed for him\nnow. That search for the aim o life had not merely disappeared\ntemporarily--he felt that it no longe existed for him and could not\npresent itself again. And this very absnce of an aim gave him the\ncomplete, joyous sense of freedom which contituted his happiness at\nthis time.\n\nHe could not see an aim, for he nw had faith--not faith in any kind of\nrule, or words, or ideas, but fath in an ever-living, ever-manifest\nGod. Formerly he had sought Him inaims he set himself. That search for\nan aim had been simply a search fr God, and suddenly in his captivity\nhe had learned not by words or resoning but by direct feeling what his\nnurse had told him long ago: tha God is here and everywhere. In his\ncaptivity he had learned that in Krataev God was greater, more infinite\nand unfathomable than in the Arcitect of the Universe recognized by the\nFreemasons. He felt like a manwho after straining his eyes to see into\nthe far distance finds what h sought at his very feet. All his life he\nhad looked over the heads ofthe men around him, when he should have\nmerely looked in front of him ithout straining his eyes.\n\nIn the past he had never been able to findthat great inscrutable\ninfinite something. He had only felt that it mut exist somewhere and\nhad looked for it. In everything near and compreensible he had only\nwhat was limited, petty, commonplace, and senseles. He had equipped\nhimself with a mental telescope and looked into remoe space, where\npetty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had semed to him\ngreat and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen.And such had\nEuropean life, politics, Freemasonry, philosophy, and phianthropy\nseemed to him. But even then, at moments of weakness as he ha accounted\nthem, his mind had penetrated to those distances and he hadthere seen\nthe same pettiness, worldliness, and senselessness. Now, hoever, he had\nlearned to see the great, eternal, and infinite in everyting, and\ntherefore--to see it and enjoy its contemplation--he naturall threw\naway the telescope through which he had till now gazed over mens heads,\nand gladly regarded the ever-changing, eternally great, unfatomable,\nand infinite life around him. And the closer he looked the mor tranquil\nand happy he became. That dreadful question, \"What for?\" whih had\nformerly destroyed all his mental edifices, no longer existed fo him.\nTo that question, \"What for?\" a simple answer was now always reay in\nhis soul: \"Because there is a God, that God without whose will no one\nhair falls from a man's head.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIn external waysPierre had hardly changed at all. In appearance he was\njust what he usd to be. As before he was absent-minded and seemed\noccupied not with wat was before his eyes but with something special of\nhis own. The diffrence between his former and present self was that\nformerly when he di not grasp what lay before him or was said to him,\nhe had puckered hisforehead painfully as if vainly seeking to\ndistinguish something at a istance. At present he still forgot what was\nsaid to him and still didnot see what was before his eyes, but he now\nlooked with a scarcely peceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what\nwas before him and listene to what was said, though evidently seeing\nand hearing something quitedifferent. Formerly he had appeared to be a\nkindhearted but unhappy ma, and so people had been inclined to avoid\nhim. Now a smile at the joyof life always played round his lips, and\nsympathy for others, shone i his eyes with a questioning look as to\nwhether they were as contentedas he was, and people felt pleased by his\npresence.\n\nPreviously he hadtalked a great deal, grew excited when he talked, and\nseldom listened;now he was seldom carried away in conversation and knew\nhow to listen o that people readily told him their most intimate\nsecrets.\n\nThe princss, who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly\nhostile to hi since she had felt herself under obligations to him after\nthe old cout's death, now after staying a short time in Orel--where she\nhad come ntending to show Pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she\nconsidere it her duty to nurse him--felt to her surprise and vexation\nthat she ad become fond of him. Pierre did not in any way seek her\napproval, hemerely studied her with interest. Formerly she had felt\nthat he regardd her with indifference and irony, and so had shrunk into\nherself as se did with others and had shown him only the combative side\nof her natre; but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most\nintimate plaes of her heart, and, mistrustfully at first but afterwards\ngratefully she let him see the hidden, kindly sides of her character.\n\nThe most unning man could not have crept into her confidence more\nsuccessfully,evoking memories of the best times of her youth and\nshowing sympathy wth them. Yet Pierre's cunning consisted simply in\nfinding pleasure in rawing out the human qualities of the embittered,\nhard, and (in her ow way) proud princess.\n\n\"Yes, he is a very, very kind man when he is no under the influence of\nbad people but of people such as myself,\" thouht she.\n\nHis servants too--Terenty and Vaska--in their own way noticedthe change\nthat had taken place in Pierre. They considered that he hadbecome much\n\"simpler.\" Terenty, when he had helped him undress and wised him good\nnight, often lingered with his master's boots in his handsand clothes\nover his arm, to see whether he would not start a talk. An Pierre,\nnoticing that Terenty wanted a chat, generally kept him there\n\n\"Well, tell me... now, how did you get food?\" he would ask.\n\nAnd Ternty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow, and of the\nold cunt, and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and\ntalking, r sometimes listening to Pierre's stories, and then would go\nout into he hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and\naffectio for him.\n\nThe doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, tough he\nconsidered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose ever moment\nwas of value to suffering humanity, would sit for hours with Perre\ntelling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the\nchracters of his patients in general, and especially of the ladies.\n\n\"Its a pleasure to talk to a man like that; he is not like our\nprovincial,\" he would say.\n\nThere were several prisoners from the French army inOrel, and the\ndoctor brought one of them, a young Italian, to see Piere.\n\nThis officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used to make un of\nthe tenderness the Italian expressed for him.\n\nThe Italian seeme happy only when he could come to see Pierre, talk\nwith him, tell him bout his past, his life at home, and his love, and\npour out to him hisindignation against the French and especially\nagainst Napoleon.\n\n\"If al Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight\nsuch a ation,\" he said to Pierre. \"You, who have suffered so from the\nFrench,do not even feel animosity toward them.\"\n\nPierre had evoked the passioate affection of the Italian merely by\nevoking the best side of his naure and taking a pleasure in so doing.\n\nDuring the last days of Pierres stay in Orel his old masonic\nacquaintance Count Willarski, who had itroduced him to the lodge in\n1807, came to see him. Willarski was marred to a Russian heiress who\nhad a large estate in Orel province, and h occupied a temporary post in\nthe commissariat department in that town\n\nHearing that Bezukhov was in Orel, Willarski, though they had never een\nintimate, came to him with the professions of friendship and intimcy\nthat people who meet in a desert generally express for one another.Willarski felt dull in Orel and was pleased to meet a man of his own\ncrcle and, as he supposed, of similar interests.\n\nBut to his surprise Wllarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged much\nbehind the times, andhad sunk, as he expressed it to himself, into\napathy and egotism.\n\n\"Yo are letting yourself go, my dear fellow,\" he said.\n\nBut for all that illarski found it pleasanter now than it had been\nformerly to be with ierre, and came to see him every day. To Pierre as\nhe looked at and litened to Willarski, it seemed strange to think that\nhe had been like tat himself but a short time before.\n\nWillarski was a married man with  family, busy with his family affairs,\nhis wife's affairs, and his offcial duties. He regarded all these\noccupations as hindrances to life, nd considered that they were all\ncontemptible because their aim was th welfare of himself and his\nfamily. Military, administrative, politica, and masonic interests\ncontinually absorbed his attention. And Pierre without trying to change\nthe other's views and without condemning him but with the quiet,\njoyful, and amused smile now habitual to him, wasinterested in this\nstrange though very familiar phenomenon.\n\nThere wasa new feature in Pierre's relations with Willarski, with the\nprincess,with the doctor, and with all the people he now met, which\ngained for im the general good will. This was his acknowledgment of the\nimpossibiity of changing a man's convictions by words, and his\nrecognition of te possibility of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing\nthings each frm his own point of view. This legitimate peculiarity of\neach individua which used to excite and irritate Pierre now became a\nbasis of the sypathy he felt for, and the interest he took in, other\npeople. The diffrence, and sometimes complete contradiction, between\nmen's opinions an their lives, and between one man and another, pleased\nhim and drew frm him an amused and gentle smile.\n\nIn practical matters Pierre unexpecedly felt within himself a center of\ngravity he had previously lacked.Formerly all pecuniary questions,\nespecially requests for money to whih, as an extremely wealthy man, he\nwas very exposed, produced in him astate of hopeless agitation and\nperplexity. \"To give or not to give?\" e had asked himself. \"I have it\nand he needs it. But someone else need it still more. Who needs it\nmost? And perhaps they are both impostors\" In the old days he had been\nunable to find a way out of all these sumises and had given to all who\nasked as long as he had anything to giv. Formerly he had been in a\nsimilar state of perplexity with regard toevery question concerning his\nproperty, when one person advised one thng and another something else.\n\nNow to his surprise he found that he n longer felt either doubt or\nperplexity about these questions. There ws now within him a judge who\nby some rule unknown to him decided what hould or should not be done.\n\nHe was as indifferent as heretofore to mney matters, but now he felt\ncertain of what ought and what ought not o be done. The first time he\nhad recourse to his new judge was when a rench prisoner, a colonel,\ncame to him and, after talking a great dealabout his exploits,\nconcluded by making what amounted to a demand thatPierre should give\nhim four thousand francs to send to his wife and chldren. Pierre\nrefused without the least difficulty or effort, and was fterwards\nsurprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear s\ninsurmountably difficult. At the same time that he refused the colone's\ndemand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice wen\nleaving Orel, to induce the Italian officer to accept some money ofwhich he was evidently in need. A further proof to Pierre of his own\nmre settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision\nith regard to his wife's debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in\nnd near Moscow.\n\nHis head steward came to him at Orel and Pierre reckoed up with him his\ndiminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost hm, according to the\nhead steward's calculation, about two million rubls.\n\nTo console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an esimate\nshowing that despite these losses his income would not be diminihed but\nwould even be increased if he refused to pay his wife's debts hich he\nwas under no obligation to meet, and did not rebuild his Mosco house\nand the country house on his Moscow estate, which had cost him ighty\nthousand rubles a year and brought in nothing.\n\n\"Yes, of course hat's true,\" said Pierre with a cheerful smile. \"I\ndon't need all thatat all. By being ruined I have become much richer.\"\n\nBut in January Saelich came from Moscow and gave him an account of the\nstate of things here, and spoke of the estimate an architect had made\nof the cost of rbuilding the town and country houses, speaking of this\nas of a settledmatter. About the same time he received letters from\nPrince Vasili andother Petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wife's\ndebts. And Pierr decided that the steward's proposals which had so\npleased him were wrng and that he must go to Petersburg and settle his\nwife's affairs andmust rebuild in Moscow. Why this was necessary he did\nnot know, but heknew for certain that it was necessary. His income\nwould be reduced bythree fourths, but he felt it must be done.\n\nWillarski was going to Mocow and they agreed to travel together.\n\nDuring the whole time of his onvalescence in Orel Pierre had\nexperienced a feeling of joy, freedom,and life; but when during his\njourney he found himself in the open word and saw hundreds of new\nfaces, that feeling was intensified. Throughut his journey he felt like\na schoolboy on holiday. Everyone--the stagcoach driver, the post-house\noverseers, the peasants on the roads and n the villages--had a new\nsignificance for him. The presence and remars of Willarski who\ncontinually deplored the ignorance and poverty of Rssia and its\nbackwardness compared with Europe only heightened Pierre' pleasure.\nWhere Willarski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary stength and\nvitality--the strength which in that vast space amid the snos\nmaintained the life of this original, peculiar, and unique people. H\ndid not contradict Willarski and even seemed to agree with him--an\naparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that\ncouldlead to nothing--and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHATER XIV\n\nIt would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose hap has\nbeen destroyed are hurrying: some from the heap dragging bits o\nrubbish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the heap, or why they\njotle, overtake one another, and fight, and it would be equally\ndifficul to explain what caused the Russians after the departure of the\nFrenchto throng to the place that had formerly been Moscow. But when we\nwatc the ants round their ruined heap, the tenacity, energy, and\nimmense nmber of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction\nof the eap, something indestructible, which though intangible is the\nreal strngth of the colony, still exists; and similarly, though in\nMoscow in te month of October there was no government and no churches,\nshrines, rches, or houses--it was still the Moscow it had been in\nAugust. All wa destroyed, except something intangible yet powerful and\nindestructibl.\n\nThe motives of those who thronged from all sides to Moscow after ithad\nbeen cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, and at frst\nfor the most part savage and brutal. One motive only they all had n\ncommon: a desire to get to the place that had been called Moscow, toapply their activities there.\n\nWithin a week Moscow already had fiftee thousand inhabitants, in a\nfortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on.By the autumn of 1813 the\nnumber, ever increasing and increasing, exceded what it had been in\n1812.\n\nThe first Russians to enter Moscow werethe Cossacks of Wintzingerode's\ndetachment, peasants from the adjacentvillages, and residents who had\nfled from Moscow and had been hiding i its vicinity. The Russians who\nentered Moscow, finding it plundered, lundered it in their turn. They\ncontinued what the French had begun. Tains of peasant carts came to\nMoscow to carry off to the villages whathad been abandoned in the\nruined houses and the streets. The Cossacks arried off what they could\nto their camps, and the householders seizedall they could find in other\nhouses and moved it to their own, pretendng that it was their property.\n\nBut the first plunderers were followedby a second and a third\ncontingent, and with increasing numbers plundeing became more and more\ndifficult and assumed more definite forms.\n\nTe French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of\nreguar life, with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship, with\nluxry, and governmental and religious institutions. These forms were\nlifeess but still existed. There were bazaars, shops, warehouses,\nmarket salls, granaries--for the most part still stocked with goods--\nand ther were factories and workshops, palaces and wealthy houses\nfilled with uxuries, hospitals, prisons, government offices, churches,\nand cathedrls. The longer the French remained the more these forms of\ntown life prished, until finally all was merged into one confused,\nlifeless sceneof plunder.\n\nThe more the plundering by the French continued, the moreboth the\nwealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destryed. But\nplundering by the Russians, with which the reoccupation of th city\nbegan, had an opposite effect: the longer it continued and the geater\nthe number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the ealth\nof the city and its regular life restored.\n\nBesides the plunderes, very various people, some drawn by curiosity,\nsome by official dutis, some by self-interest--house owners, clergy,\nofficials of all kinds tradesmen, artisans, and peasants--streamed into\nMoscow as blood flow to the heart.\n\nWithin a week the peasants who came with empty carts t carry off\nplunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart th corpses out\nof the town. Other peasants, having heard of their comrads'\ndiscomfiture, came to town bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat don\none another's prices to below what they had been in former days. Gans\nof carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in Moscow every day, and o\nall sides logs were being hewn, new houses built, and old, charred ons\nrepaired. Tradesmen began trading in booths. Cookshops and taverns wre\nopened in partially burned houses. The clergy resumed the services n\nmany churches that had not been burned. Donors contributed Church\nprperty that had been stolen. Government clerks set up their baize-\ncoveed tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms. The\nhighe authorities and the police organized the distribution of goods\nleft bhind by the French. The owners of houses in which much property\nhad ben left, brought there from other houses, complained of the\ninjustice o taking everything to the Faceted Palace in the Kremlin;\nothers insistd that as the French had gathered things from different\nhouses into ths or that house, it would be unfair to allow its owner to\nkeep all tha was found there. They abused the police and bribed them,\nmade out estmates at ten times their value for government stores that\nhad perishedin the fire, and demanded relief. And Count Rostopchin\nwrote proclamatons.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nAt the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and sayed in an annex of\nhis house which had not been burned. He called on ount Rostopchin and\non some acquaintances who were back in Moscow, andhe intended to leave\nfor Petersburg two days later. Everybody was celerating the victory,\neverything was bubbling with life in the ruined bu reviving city.\nEveryone was pleased to see Pierre, everyone wished tomeet him, and\neveryone questioned him about what he had seen. Pierre flt particularly\nwell disposed toward them all, but was now instinctivey on his guard\nfor fear of binding himself in any way. To all question put to him--\nwhether important or quite trifling--such as: Where woul he live? Was\nhe going to rebuild? When was he going to Petersburg andwould he mind\ntaking a parcel for someone?--he replied: \"Yes, perhaps, or, \"I think\nso,\" and so on.\n\nHe had heard that the Rostovs were at Kstroma but the thought of\nNatasha seldom occurred to him. If it did itwas only as a pleasant\nmemory of the distant past. He felt himself notonly free from social\nobligations but also from that feeling which, itseemed to him, he had\naroused in himself.\n\nOn the third day after his rrival he heard from the Drubetskoys that\nPrincess Mary was in Moscow.The death, sufferings, and last days of\nPrince Andrew had often occupid Pierre's thoughts and now recurred to\nhim with fresh vividness. Havig heard at dinner that Princess Mary was\nin Moscow and living in her huse--which had not been burned--in\nVozdvizhenka Street, he drove that ame evening to see her.\n\nOn his way to the house Pierre kept thinking f Prince Andrew, of their\nfriendship, of his various meetings with him and especially of the last\none at Borodino.\n\n\"Is it possible that he ied in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?\nIs it possible that th meaning of life was not disclosed to him before\nhe died?\" thought Piere. He recalled Karataev and his death and\ninvoluntarily began to compre these two men, so different, and yet so\nsimilar in that they had boh lived and both died and in the love he\nfelt for both of them.\n\nPierr drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood.\nThe huse had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but its\ngeneral asect was unchanged. The old footman, who met Pierre with a\nstern face a if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence of\nthe old princ had not disturbed the order of things in the house,\ninformed him thatthe princess had gone to her own apartments, and that\nshe received on undays.\n\n\"Announce me. Perhaps she will see me,\" said Pierre.\n\n\"Yes, sr,\" said the man. \"Please step into the portrait gallery.\"\n\nA few minues later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought\nword from th princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he\nwould excuseher want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment.\n\nIn a rather ow room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her\nanother persondressed in black. Pierre remembered that the princess\nalways had lady ompanions, but who they were and what they were like he\nnever knew or emembered. \"This must be one of her companions,\" he\nthought, glancing t the lady in the black dress.\n\nThe princess rose quickly to meet him nd held out her hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, looking at his altered face afer he had kissed her\nhand, \"so this is how we meet again. He spoke of ou even at the very\nlast,\" she went on, turning her eyes from Pierre t her companion with a\nshyness that surprised him for an instant.\n\n\"I ws so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of good\nnews e had received for a long time.\"\n\nAgain the princess glanced round at er companion with even more\nuneasiness in her manner and was about to dd something, but Pierre\ninterrupted her.\n\n\"Just imagine--I knew nothig about him!\" said he. \"I thought he had\nbeen killed. All I know I head at second hand from others. I only know\nthat he fell in with the Rosovs.... What a strange coincidence!\"\n\nPierre spoke rapidly and with anmation. He glanced once at the\ncompanion's face, saw her attentive andkindly gaze fixed on him, and,\nas often happens when one is talking, flt somehow that this companion\nin the black dress was a good, kind, exellent creature who would not\nhinder his conversing freely with Princes Mary.\n\nBut when he mentioned the Rostovs, Princess Mary's face expresed still\ngreater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierres face to\nthat of the lady in the black dress and said:\n\n\"Do you reall not recognize her?\"\n\nPierre looked again at the companion's pale, delcate face with its\nblack eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near t him, long forgotten\nand more than sweet, looked at him from those attntive eyes.\n\n\"But no, it can't be!\" he thought. \"This stern, thin, pal face that\nlooks so much older! It cannot be she. It merely reminds meof her.\" But\nat that moment Princess Mary said, \"Natasha!\" And with dificulty,\neffort, and stress, like the opening of a door grown rusty onits\nhinges, a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and rom\nthat opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierrewith\na happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even ben\nthinking--especially at that moment. It suffused him, seized him, an\nenveloped him completely. When she smiled doubt was no longer possibl,\nit was Natasha and he loved her.\n\nAt that moment Pierre involuntaril betrayed to her, to Princess Mary,\nand above all to himself, a secretof which he himself had been unaware.\nHe flushed joyfully yet with paiful distress. He tried to hide his\nagitation. But the more he tried tohide it the more clearly--clearer\nthan any words could have done--did e betray to himself, to her, and to\nPrincess Mary that he loved her.\n\nNo, it's only the unexpectedness of it,\" thought Pierre. But as soon a\nhe tried to continue the conversation he had begun with Princess Maryhe\nagain glanced at Natasha, and a still-deeper flush suffused his fac and\na still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his sou. He\nbecame confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what h was\nsaying.\n\nPierre had failed to notice Natasha because he did not a all expect to\nsee her there, but he had failed to recognize her becaue the change in\nher since he last saw her was immense. She had grown tin and pale, but\nthat was not what made her unrecognizable; she was unecognizable at the\nmoment he entered because on that face whose eyes hd always shone with\na suppressed smile of the joy of life, now when hefirst entered and\nglanced at her there was not the least shadow of a sile: only her eyes\nwere kindly attentive and sadly interrogative.\n\nPiere's confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Natasha's part,\nbt only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\"She has come to stay with me,\" said Princess Mary. \"Thecount and\ncountess will be here in a few days. The countess is in a dradful\nstate; but it was necessary for Natasha herself to see a doctor.They\ninsisted on her coming with me.\"\n\n\"Yes, is there a family free frm sorrow now?\" said Pierre, addressing\nNatasha. \"You know it happened he very day we were rescued. I saw him.\nWhat a delightful boy he was!\"\nNatasha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her eyes\nwidned and lit up.\n\n\"What can one say or think of as a consolation?\" saidPierre. \"Nothing!\nWhy had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die\"\n\n\"Yes, in these days it would be hard to live without faith...\" remaked\nPrincess Mary.\n\n\"Yes, yes, that is really true,\" Pierre hastily inerrupted her.\n\n\"Why is it true?\" Natasha asked, looking attentively ino Pierre's eyes.\n\n\"How can you ask why?\" said Princess Mary. \"The thouht alone of what\nawaits...\"\n\nNatasha without waiting for Princess Maryto finish again looked\ninquiringly at Pierre.\n\n\"And because,\" Pierre cntinued, \"only one who believes that there is a\nGod ruling us can beara loss such as hers and... yours.\"\n\nNatasha had already opened her mouh to speak but suddenly stopped.\nPierre hurriedly turned away from herand again addressed Princess Mary,\nasking about his friend's last days\n\nPierre's confusion had now almost vanished, but at the same time he elt\nthat his freedom had also completely gone. He felt that there was ow a\njudge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more t him\nthan that of all the rest of the world. As he spoke now he was\ncosidering what impression his words would make on Natasha. He did not\nprposely say things to please her, but whatever he was saying he\nregardd from her standpoint.\n\nPrincess Mary--reluctantly as is usual in suchcases--began telling of\nthe condition in which she had found Prince Anrew. But Pierre's face\nquivering with emotion, his questions and his eger restless expression,\ngradually compelled her to go into details whch she feared to recall\nfor her own sake.\n\n\"Yes, yes, and so...?\" Piere kept saying as he leaned toward her with\nhis whole body and eagerly istened to her story. \"Yes, yes... so he\ngrew tranquil and softened? Wth all his soul he had always sought one\nthing--to be perfectly good--o he could not be afraid of death. The\nfaults he had--if he had any--wre not of his making. So he did\nsoften?... What a happy thing that he aw you again,\" he added, suddenly\nturning to Natasha and looking at he with eyes full of tears.\n\nNatasha's face twitched. She frowned and loered her eyes for a moment.\nShe hesitated for an instant whether to spak or not.\n\n\"Yes, that was happiness,\" she then said in her quiet voic with its\ndeep chest notes. \"For me it certainly was happiness.\" She pused. \"And\nhe... he... he said he was wishing for it at the very momen I entered\nthe room....\"\n\nNatasha's voice broke. She blushed, pressed er clasped hands on her\nknees, and then controlling herself with an evdent effort lifted her\nhead and began to speak rapidly.\n\n\"We knew nothng of it when we started from Moscow. I did not dare to\nask about him.Then suddenly Sonya told me he was traveling with us. I\nhad no idea an could not imagine what state he was in, all I wanted was\nto see him ad be with him,\" she said, trembling, and breathing quickly.\n\nAnd not ltting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had\nnever yet metioned to anyone--all she had lived through during those\nthree weeks o their journey and life at Yaroslavl.\n\nPierre listened to her with lip parted and eyes fixed upon her full of\ntears. As he listened he did nt think of Prince Andrew, nor of death,\nnor of what she was telling. H listened to her and felt only pity for\nher, for what she was sufferin now while she was speaking.\n\nPrincess Mary, frowning in her effort tohold back her tears, sat beside\nNatasha, and heard for the first time he story of those last days of\nher brother's and Natasha's love.\n\nEvidntly Natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.\n\nShe spoke, ingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of\nher soul, ad it seemed as if she could never finish. Several times she\nrepeated te same thing twice.\n\nDessalles' voice was heard outside the door askin whether little\nNicholas might come in to say good night.\n\n\"Well, thats all--everything,\" said Natasha.\n\nShe got up quickly just as Nicholasentered, almost ran to the door\nwhich was hidden by curtains, struck hr head against it, and rushed\nfrom the room with a moan either of painor sorrow.\n\nPierre gazed at the door through which she had disappearedand did not\nunderstand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world.\n\nPincess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention\nt her nephew who had entered the room.\n\nAt that moment of emotional tenerness young Nicholas' face, which\nresembled his father's, affected Pirre so much that when he had kissed\nthe boy he got up quickly, took ou his handkerchief, and went to the\nwindow. He wished to take leave of rincess Mary, but she would not let\nhim go.\n\n\"No, Natasha and I someties don't go to sleep till after two, so please\ndon't go. I will order upper. Go downstairs, we will come immediately.\"\n\nBefore Pierre left te room Princess Mary told him: \"This is the first\ntime she has talked f him like that.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nPierre was shown into the large, bightly lit dining room; a few minutes\nlater he heard footsteps and Pricess Mary entered with Natasha. Natasha\nwas calm, though a severe and rave expression had again settled on her\nface. They all three of them ow experienced that feeling of awkwardness\nwhich usually follows aftera serious and heartfelt talk. It is\nimpossible to go back to the same onversation, to talk of trifles is\nawkward, and yet the desire to spea is there and silence seems like\naffectation. They went silently to tale. The footmen drew back the\nchairs and pushed them up again. Pierre nfolded his cold table napkin\nand, resolving to break the silence, looed at Natasha and at Princess\nMary. They had evidently both formed thesame resolution; the eyes of\nboth shone with satisfaction and a confesion that besides sorrow life\nalso has joy.\n\n\"Do you take vodka, Count? asked Princess Mary, and those words\nsuddenly banished the shadows ofthe past. \"Now tell us about yourself,\"\nsaid she. \"One hears such imprbable wonders about you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Pierre with the smile of mil irony now habitual to him.\n\"They even tell me wonders I myself never reamed of! Mary Abramovna\ninvited me to her house and kept telling me hat had happened, or ought\nto have happened, to me. Stepan Stepanych aso instructed me how I ought\nto tell of my experiences. In general I hve noticed that it is very\neasy to be an interesting man (I am an inteesting man now); people\ninvite me out and tell me all about myself.\"\n\natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking.\n\n\"We have been told,\" rincess Mary interrupted her, \"that you lost two\nmillions in Moscow. I that true?\"\n\n\"But I am three times as rich as before,\" returned Pierr.\n\nThough the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wifes\ndebts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained that he hadbecome three times as rich as before.\n\n\"What I have certainly gained i freedom,\" he began seriously, but did\nnot continue, noticing that thi theme was too egotistic.\n\n\"And are you building?\"\n\n\"Yes. Savelich say I must!\"\n\n\"Tell me, you did not know of the countess' death when you ecided to\nremain in Moscow?\" asked Princess Mary and immediately blushd, noticing\nthat her question, following his mention of freedom, ascried to his\nwords a meaning he had perhaps not intended.\n\n\"No,\" answeredPierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning\nPrincess Mary ha given to his words. \"I heard of it in Orel and you\ncannot imagine howit shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple,\" he\nadded quickly, glacing at Natasha and noticing on her face curiosity as\nto how he would peak of his wife, \"but her death shocked me terribly.\nWhen two people uarrel they are always both in fault, and one's own\nguilt suddenly becmes terribly serious when the other is no longer\nalive. And then such  death... without friends and without consolation!\nI am very, very sory for her,\" he concluded, and was pleased to notice\na look of glad appoval on Natasha's face.\n\n\"Yes, and so you are once more an eligible bahelor,\" said Princess\nMary.\n\nPierre suddenly flushed crimson and for along time tried not to look at\nNatasha. When he ventured to glance herway again her face was cold,\nstern, and he fancied even contemptuous.\n\"And did you really see and speak to Napoleon, as we have been told?\"\naid Princess Mary.\n\nPierre laughed.\n\n\"No, not once! Everybody seems toimagine that being taken prisoner\nmeans being Napoleon's guest. Not ony did I never see him but I heard\nnothing about him--I was in much lowr company!\"\n\nSupper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to spea about his\ncaptivity was gradually led on to do so.\n\n\"But it's true tht you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?\" Natasha\nasked with a sligh smile. \"I guessed it then when we met at the\nSukharev tower, do you rmember?\"\n\nPierre admitted that it was true, and from that was graduall led by\nPrincess Mary's questions and especially by Natasha's into givng a\ndetailed account of his adventures.\n\nAt first he spoke with the aused and mild irony now customary with him\ntoward everybody and especilly toward himself, but when he came to\ndescribe the horrors and suffeings he had witnessed he was\nunconsciously carried away and began speaing with the suppressed\nemotion of a man re-experiencing in recollectin strong impressions he\nhas lived through.\n\nPrincess Mary with a gentl smile looked now at Pierre and now at\nNatasha. In the whole narrativeshe saw only Pierre and his goodness.\nNatasha, leaning on her elbow, te expression of her face constantly\nchanging with the narrative, watchd Pierre with an attention that never\nwandered--evidently herself expeiencing all that he described. Not only\nher look, but her exclamationsand the brief questions she put, showed\nPierre that she understood jus what he wished to convey. It was clear\nthat she understood not only wat he said but also what he wished to,\nbut could not, express in words The account Pierre gave of the incident\nwith the child and the woman or protecting whom he was arrested was\nthis: \"It was an awful sight--cildren abandoned, some in the flames...\nOne was snatched out before myeyes... and there were women who had\ntheir things snatched off and ther earrings torn out...\" he flushed and\ngrew confused. \"Then a patrol arived and all the men--all those who\nwere not looting, that is--were arested, and I among them.\"\n\n\"I am sure you're not telling us everythin; I am sure you did\nsomething...\" said Natasha and pausing added, \"somthing fine?\"\n\nPierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wantd to pass over\nthe horrible details, but Natasha insisted that he shoud not omit\nanything.\n\nPierre began to tell about Karataev, but paused.By this time he had\nrisen from the table and was pacing the room, Nataha following him with\nher eyes. Then he added:\n\n\"No, you can't understnd what I learned from that illiterate man--that\nsimple fellow.\"\n\n\"Yes yes, go on!\" said Natasha. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"They killed him almost beore my eyes.\"\n\nAnd Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on totell of the last\ndays of their retreat, of Karataev's illness and his eath.\n\nHe told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. Henow, as\nit were, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. Now tha he was\ntelling it all to Natasha he experienced that pleasure which aman has\nwhen women listen to him--not clever women who when listening ither try\nto remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when oportunity\noffers to retell it, or who wish to adopt it to some thought f their\nown and promptly contribute their own clever comments preparedin their\nlittle mental workshop--but the pleasure given by real women ifted with\na capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows o himself.\nNatasha without knowing it was all attention: she did not loe a word,\nno single quiver in Pierre's voice, no look, no twitch of a uscle in\nhis face, nor a single gesture. She caught the unfinished wor in its\nflight and took it straight into her open heart, divining the ecret\nmeaning of all Pierre's mental travail.\n\nPrincess Mary understoo his story and sympathized with him, but she now\nsaw something else tht absorbed all her attention. She saw the\npossibility of love and happness between Natasha and Pierre, and the\nfirst thought of this filled er heart with gladness.\n\nIt was three o'clock in the morning. The footen came in with sad and\nstern faces to change the candles, but no one oticed them.\n\nPierre finished his story. Natasha continued to look at im intently\nwith bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying tounderstand\nsomething more which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre in hamefaced\nand happy confusion glanced occasionally at her, and tried t think what\nto say next to introduce a fresh subject. Princess Mary wa silent. It\noccurred to none of them that it was three o'clock and tim to go to\nbed.\n\n\"People speak of misfortunes and sufferings,\" remarkedPierre, \"but if\nat this moment I were asked: 'Would you rather be whatyou were before\nyou were taken prisoner, or go through all this again? then for\nheaven's sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh! Weimagine\nthat when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost, butit is\nonly then that what is new and good begins. While there is life here is\nhappiness. There is much, much before us. I say this to you,\" e added,\nturning to Natasha.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she said, answering somethin quite different. \"I too should\nwish nothing but to relive it all fromthe beginning.\"\n\nPierre looked intently at her.\n\n\"Yes, and nothing mor,\" said Natasha.\n\n\"It's not true, not true!\" cried Pierre. \"I am not t blame for being\nalive and wishing to live--nor you either.\"\n\nSuddenlyNatasha bent her head, covered her face with her hands, and\nbegan to cy.\n\n\"What is it, Natasha?\" said Princess Mary.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing.\" Sh smiled at Pierre through her tears. \"Good night!\nIt is time for bed.\"\nPierre rose and took his leave.\n\nPrincess Mary and Natasha met as usul in the bedroom. They talked of\nwhat Pierre had told them. Princess Mry did not express her opinion of\nPierre nor did Natasha speak of him.\n\"Well, good night, Mary!\" said Natasha. \"Do you know, I am often afrad\nthat by not speaking of him\" (she meant Prince Andrew) \"for fear of ot\ndoing justice to our feelings, we forget him.\"\n\nPrincess Mary sighe deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of\nNatasha's remark, but he did not express agreement in words.\n\n\"Is it possible to forget?\" sad she.\n\n\"It did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was har and\npainful, but good, very good!\" said Natasha. \"I am sure he reallyloved\nhim. That is why I told him... Was it all right?\" she added, sudenly\nblushing.\n\n\"To tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!\" aid Princess\nMary.\n\n\"Do you know, Mary...\" Natasha suddenly said with  mischievous smile\nsuch as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for  long time, \"he has\nsomehow grown so clean, smooth, and fresh--as if h had just come out of\na Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a mora bath. Isn't it true?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Princess Mary. \"He has greatly mproved.\"\n\n\"With a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, ust as if he\nhad come straight from the bath... Papa used to...\"\n\n\"I uderstand why he\" (Prince Andrew) \"liked no one so much as him,\"\nsaid Pincess Mary.\n\n\"Yes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are frends when they\nare quite different. That must be true. Really he is qute unlike him--\nin everything.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he's wonderful.\"\n\n\"Well, god night,\" said Natasha.\n\nAnd the same mischievous smile lingered for along time on her face as\nif it had been forgotten there.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIt was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night. Hepaced\nup and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult prblem\nand frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing, ad now\nsmiling happily.\n\nHe was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Natasha, nd of their love, at one\nmoment jealous of her past, then reproaching imself for that feeling.\nIt was already six in the morning and he stil paced up and down the\nroom.\n\n\"Well, what's to be done if it cannot beavoided? What's to be done?\nEvidently it has to be so,\" said he to himelf, and hastily undressing\nhe got into bed, happy and agitated but fre from hesitation or\nindecision.\n\n\"Strange and impossible as such happness seems, I must do everything\nthat she and I may be man and wife,\" e told himself.\n\nA few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petrsburg on the\nFriday. When he awoke on the Thursday, Savelich came to sk him about\npacking for the journey.\n\n\"What, to Petersburg? What is Ptersburg? Who is there in Petersburg?\"\nhe asked involuntarily, though nly to himself. \"Oh, yes, long ago\nbefore this happened I did for somereason mean to go to Petersburg,\" he\nreflected. \"Why? But perhaps I shll go. What a good fellow he is and\nhow attentive, and how he remember everything,\" he thought, looking at\nSavelich's old face, \"and what a leasant smile he has!\"\n\n\"Well, Savelich, do you still not wish to accet your freedom?\" Pierre\nasked him.\n\n\"What's the good of freedom to me,your excellency? We lived under the\nlate count--the kingdom of heaven e his!--and we have lived under you\ntoo, without ever being wronged.\"\n\"And your children?\"\n\n\"The children will live just the same. With suchmasters one can live.\"\n\n\"But what about my heirs?\" said Pierre. \"Suppoing I suddenly marry...\nit might happen,\" he added with an involuntarysmile.\n\n\"If I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a goo thing.\"\n\n\"How easy he thinks it,\" thought Pierre. \"He doesn't know ho terrible\nit is and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is terrile!\"\n\n\"So what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?\" asked Saveich.\n\n\"No, I'll put it off for a bit. I'll tell you later. You must fogive\nthe trouble I have put you to,\" said Pierre, and seeing Savelich mile,\nhe thought: \"But how strange it is that he should not know that ow\nthere is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be settled first f\nall! But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending. Shll\nI have a talk with him and see what he thinks?\" Pierre reflected. \"o,\nanother time.\"\n\nAt breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, hat he had been to\nsee Princess Mary the day before and had there met-\"Whom do you think?\nNatasha Rostova!\"\n\nThe princess seemed to see nothng more extraordinary in that than if he\nhad seen Anna Semenovna.\n\n\"Doyou know her?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"I have seen the princess,\" she replied.\"I heard that they were\narranging a match for her with young Rostov. I would be a very good\nthing for the Rostovs, they are said to be uttery ruined.\"\n\n\"No; I mean do you know Natasha Rostova?\"\n\n\"I heard about hat affair of hers at the time. It was a great pity.\"\n\n\"No, she eitherdoesn't understand or is pretending,\" thought Pierre.\n\"Better not say nything to her either.\"\n\nThe princess too had prepared provisions for ierre's journey.\n\n\"How kind they all are,\" thought Pierre. \"What is suprising is that\nthey should trouble about these things now when it canno longer be of\ninterest to them. And all for me!\"\n\nOn the same day th Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him to send\na representativeto the Faceted Palace to recover things that were to be\nreturned to thir owners that day.\n\n\"And this man too,\" thought Pierre, looking into he face of the Chief\nof Police. \"What a fine, good-looking officer andhow kind. Fancy\nbothering about such trifles now! And they actually sa he is not honest\nand takes bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why should't he take bribes?\nThat's the way he was brought up, and everybody doe it. But what a\nkind, pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at m.\"\n\nPierre went to Princess Mary's to dinner.\n\nAs he drove through thestreets past the houses that had been burned\ndown, he was surprised bythe beauty of those ruins. The picturesqueness\nof the chimney stacks ad tumble-down walls of the burned-out quarters\nof the town, stretchingout and concealing one another, reminded him of\nthe Rhine and the Coloseum. The cabmen he met and their passengers, the\ncarpenters cutting te timber for new houses with axes, the women\nhawkers, and the shopkeeprs, all looked at him with cheerful beaming\neyes that seemed to say: \"h, there he is! Let's see what will come of\nit!\"\n\nAt the entrance to Pincess Mary's house Pierre felt doubtful whether he\nhad really been thre the night before and really seen Natasha and\ntalked to her. \"Perhap I imagined it; perhaps I shall go in and find no\none there.\" But he hd hardly entered the room before he felt her\npresence with his whole bing by the loss of his sense of freedom. She\nwas in the same black dres with soft folds and her hair was done the\nsame way as the day before yet she was quite different. Had she been\nlike this when he entered te day before he could not for a moment have\nfailed to recognize her.\n\nhe was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince\nAnrew's fiancee. A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on\nhe face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression.\n\nPierre dined wth them and would have spent the whole evening there, but\nPrincess Mar was going to vespers and Pierre left the house with her.\n\nNext day hecame early, dined, and stayed the whole evening. Though\nPrincess Mary nd Natasha were evidently glad to see their visitor and\nthough all Piere's interest was now centered in that house, by the\nevening they had alked over everything and the conversation passed from\none trivial topc to another and repeatedly broke off. He stayed so long\nthat PrincessMary and Natasha exchanged glances, evidently wondering\nwhen he would o. Pierre noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy\nand embarrasse, but sat on because he simply could not get up and take\nhis leave.\n\nPincess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and complaining ofa headache began to say good night.\n\n\"So you are going to Petersburg tmorrow?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, I am not going,\" Pierre replied hastily, in  surprised tone and as\nthough offended. \"Yes... no... to Petersburg? Tmorrow--but I won't say\ngood-by yet. I will call round in case you hav any commissions for me,\"\nsaid he, standing before Princess Mary and trning red, but not taking\nhis departure.\n\nNatasha gave him her hand an went out. Princess Mary on the other hand\ninstead of going away sank nto an armchair, and looked sternly and\nintently at him with her deep,radiant eyes. The weariness she had\nplainly shown before had now quitepassed off. With a deep and long-\ndrawn sigh she seemed to be preparedfor a lengthy talk.\n\nWhen Natasha left the room Pierre's confusion andawkwardness\nimmediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement He quickly\nmoved an armchair toward Princess Mary.\n\n\"Yes, I wanted totell you,\" said he, answering her look as if she had\nspoken. \"Princess help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess, my\ndear friend, liste! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of her, I\nknow it's impossibleto speak of it now. But I want to be a brother to\nher. No, not that, Idon't, I can't...\"\n\nHe paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hads.\n\n\"Well,\" he went on with an evident effort at self-control and cohrence.\n\"I don't know when I began to love her, but I have loved her an her\nalone all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine life wthout\nher. I cannot propose to her at present, but the thought that pehaps\nshe might someday be my wife and that I may be missing that\npossiility... that possibility... is terrible. Tell me, can I hope?\nTell mewhat I am to do, dear princess!\" he added after a pause, and\ntouched hr hand as she did not reply.\n\n\"I am thinking of what you have told me, answered Princess Mary. \"This\nis what I will say. You are right that o speak to her of love at\npresent...\"\n\nPrincess Mary stopped. She was oing to say that to speak of love was\nimpossible, but she stopped becase she had seen by the sudden change in\nNatasha two days before that se would not only not be hurt if Pierre\nspoke of his love, but that it as the very thing she wished for.\n\n\"To speak to her now wouldn't do,\" aid the princess all the same.\n\n\"But what am I to do?\"\n\n\"Leave it to m,\" said Princess Mary. \"I know...\"\n\nPierre was looking into Princess Mry's eyes.\n\n\"Well?... Well?...\" he said.\n\n\"I know that she loves... wil love you,\" Princess Mary corrected\nherself.\n\nBefore her words were ot, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened\nexpression seized Princes Mary's hand.\n\n\"What makes you think so? You think I may hope? You thnk...?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so,\" said Princess Mary with a smile. \"Write toher\nparents, and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish itto\nhappen and my heart tells me it will.\"\n\n\"No, it cannot be! How happ I am! But it can't be.... How happy I am!\nNo, it can't be!\" Pierre ket saying as he kissed Princess Mary's hands.\n\n\"Go to Petersburg, that ill be best. And I will write to you,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"To Petersburg? Go tere? Very well, I'll go. But I may come again\ntomorrow?\"\n\nNext day Piere came to say good-by. Natasha was less animated than she\nhad been th day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre\nsometimes felt asif he was vanishing and that neither he nor she\nexisted any longer, tht nothing existed but happiness. \"Is it possible?\nNo, it can't be,\" hetold himself at every look, gesture, and word that\nfilled his soul wit joy.\n\nWhen on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he couldnot help\nholding it a little longer in his own.\n\n\"Is it possible that his hand, that face, those eyes, all this treasure\nof feminine charm s strange to me now, is it possible that it will one\nday be mine foreve, as familiar to me as I am to myself?... No, that's\nimpossible!...\"\n\nGood-bye, Count,\" she said aloud. \"I shall look forward very much to\nyur return,\" she added in a whisper.\n\nAnd these simple words, her look,and the expression on her face which\naccompanied them, formed for two onths the subject of inexhaustible\nmemories, interpretations, and happ meditations for Pierre. \"'I shall\nlook forward very much to your retun....' Yes, yes, how did she say it?\nYes, 'I shall look forward very mch to your return.' Oh, how happy I\nam! What is happening to me? How hppy I am!\" said Pierre to himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nThere was nothing n Pierre's soul now at all like what had troubled it\nduring his courtsip of Helene.\n\nHe did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling o shame the words\nhe had spoken, or say: \"Oh, why did I not say that?\" nd, \"Whatever made\nme say 'Je vous aime'?\" On the contrary, he now repated in imagination\nevery word that he or Natasha had spoken and pictued every detail of\nher face and smile, and did not wish to diminish oradd anything, but\nonly to repeat it again and again. There was now nota shadow of doubt\nin his mind as to whether what he had undertaken wasright or wrong.\nOnly one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind: \"Wsn't it all a\ndream? Isn't Princess Mary mistaken? Am I not too conceied and self-\nconfident? I believe all this--and suddenly Princess Marywill tell her,\nand she will be sure to smile and say: 'How strange! Hemust be deluding\nhimself. Doesn't he know that he is a man, just a man while I...? I am\nsomething altogether different and higher.'\"\n\nThat ws the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not now make any\nplans The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only\nhe cold attain it, it would be the end of all things. Everything ended\nwiththat.\n\nA joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself inapable,\npossessed him. The whole meaning of life--not for him alone bu for the\nwhole world--seemed to him centered in his love and the possiility of\nbeing loved by her. At times everybody seemed to him to be ocupied with\none thing only--his future happiness. Sometimes it seemed t him that\nother people were all as pleased as he was himself and merel tried to\nhide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other intersts. In\nevery word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness. He oten\nsurprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smileswhich\nseemed to express a secret understanding between him and them. Ad when\nhe realized that people might not be aware of his happiness, hepitied\nthem with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain o them\nthat all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworth of\nattention.\n\nWhen it was suggested to him that he should enter the ivil service, or\nwhen the war or any general political affairs were dicussed on the\nassumption that everybody's welfare depended on this or hat issue of\nevents, he would listen with a mild and pitying smile andsurprise\npeople by his strange comments. But at this time he saw everyody--both\nthose who, as he imagined, understood the real meaning of lie (that is,\nwhat he was feeling) and those unfortunates who evidently id not\nunderstand it--in the bright light of the emotion that shone wihin\nhimself, and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met\neveything that was good and worthy of being loved.\n\nWhen dealing with theaffairs and papers of his dead wife, her memory\naroused in him no feelng but pity that she had not known the bliss he\nnow knew. Prince Vasil, who having obtained a new post and some fresh\ndecorations was particlarly proud at this time, seemed to him a\npathetic, kindly old man muc to be pitied.\n\nOften in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blisful insanity. All\nthe views he formed of men and circumstances at thistime remained true\nfor him always. He not only did not renounce them sbsequently, but when\nhe was in doubt or inwardly at variance, he refered to the views he had\nheld at this time of his madness and they alway proved correct.\n\n\"I may have appeared strange and queer then,\" he thoght, \"but I was not\nso mad as I seemed. On the contrary I was then wisr and had more\ninsight than at any other time, and understood all thatis worth\nunderstanding in life, because... because I was happy.\"\n\nPiere's insanity consisted in not waiting, as he used to do, to\ndiscover prsonal attributes which he termed \"good qualities\" in people\nbefore loing them; his heart was now overflowing with love, and by\nloving peopl without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving\nthem.\n\n\n\n\nCAPTER XX\n\nAfter Pierre's departure that first evening, when Natasha ha said to\nPrincess Mary with a gaily mocking smile: \"He looks just, yes just as\nif he had come out of a Russian bath--in a short coat and wit his hair\ncropped,\" something hidden and unknown to herself, but irrepessible,\nawoke in Natasha's soul.\n\nEverything: her face, walk, look, ad voice, was suddenly altered. To\nher own surprise a power of life andhope of happiness rose to the\nsurface and demanded satisfaction. From hat evening she seemed to have\nforgotten all that had happened to her.She no longer complained of her\nposition, did not say a word about thepast, and no longer feared to\nmake happy plans for the future. She spoe little of Pierre, but when\nPrincess Mary mentioned him a long-extingished light once more kindled\nin her eyes and her lips curved with a srange smile.\n\n\nThe change that took place in Natasha at first surprise Princess Mary;\nbut when she understood its meaning it grieved her. \"Cn she have loved\nmy brother so little as to be able to forget him so son?\" she thought\nwhen she reflected on the change. But when she was wih Natasha she was\nnot vexed with her and did not reproach her. The reaakened power of\nlife that had seized Natasha was so evidently irrepresible and\nunexpected by her that in her presence Princess Mary felt tha she had\nno right to reproach her even in her heart.\n\nNatasha gave herelf up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that\nshe did not try t hide the fact that she was no longer sad, but bright\nand cheerful.\n\nWen Princess Mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with\nPirre, Natasha met her on the threshold.\n\n\"He has spoken? Yes? He has spken?\" she repeated.\n\nAnd a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemedto beg forgiveness for\nher joy settled on Natasha's face.\n\n\"I wanted t listen at the door, but I knew you would tell me.\"\n\nUnderstandable an touching as the look with which Natasha gazed at her\nseemed to Princes Mary, and sorry as she was to see her agitation,\nthese words pained er for a moment. She remembered her brother and his\nlove.\n\n\"But what'sto be done? She can't help it,\" thought the princess.\n\nAnd with a sad nd rather stern look she told Natasha all that Pierre\nhad said. On heaing that he was going to Petersburg Natasha was\nastounded.\n\n\"To Petersurg!\" she repeated as if unable to understand.\n\nBut noticing the grievd expression on Princess Mary's face she guessed\nthe reason of that saness and suddenly began to cry.\n\n\"Mary,\" said she, \"tell me what I shold do! I am afraid of being bad.\nWhatever you tell me, I will do. Tellme....\"\n\n\"You love him?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" whispered Natasha.\n\n\"Then why are youcrying? I am happy for your sake,\" said Princess Mary,\nwho because of hose tears quite forgave Natasha's joy.\n\n\"It won't be just yet--someda. Think what fun it will be when I am his\nwife and you marry Nicholas!\n\n\"Natasha, I have asked you not to speak of that. Let us talk about yu.\"\n\nThey were silent awhile.\n\n\"But why go to Petersburg?\" Natasha sudenly asked, and hastily replied\nto her own question. \"But no, no, he mst... Yes, Mary, He must....\"\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE: 1813 - 20\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\nSeven years had passed. The storm-tossed sea of European history had\nubsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. But the\nmystrious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of\ntheir otion are unknown to us) continued to operate.\n\nThough the surface of he sea of history seemed motionless, the movement\nof humanity went on s unceasingly as the flow of time. Various groups\nof people formed anddissolved, the coming formation and dissolution of\nkingdoms and displaement of peoples was in course of preparation.\n\nThe sea of history wasnot driven spasmodically from shore to shore as\npreviously. It was seehing in its depths. Historic figures were not\nborne by the waves from ne shore to another as before. They now seemed\nto rotate on one spot. he historical figures at the head of armies, who\nformerly reflected th movement of the masses by ordering wars,\ncampaigns, and battles, now eflected the restless movement by political\nand diplomatic combination, laws, and treaties.\n\nThe historians call this activity of the historcal figures \"the\nreaction.\"\n\nIn dealing with this period they sternly ondemn the historical\npersonages who, in their opinion, caused what thy describe as the\nreaction. All the well-known people of that period, rom Alexander and\nNapoleon to Madame de Stael, Photius, Schelling, Ficte, Chateaubriand,\nand the rest, pass before their stern judgment seatand are acquitted or\ncondemned according to whether they conduced to pogress or to reaction.\n\nAccording to their accounts a reaction took plce at that time in Russia\nalso, and the chief culprit was Alexander I,the same man who according\nto them was the chief cause of the liberal ovement at the commencement\nof his reign, being the savior of Russia.\nThere is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy essayist to\nearned historian, who does not throw his little stone at Alexander forthings he did wrong at this period of his reign.\n\n\"He ought to have aced in this way and in that way. In this case he did\nwell and in that cse badly. He behaved admirably at the beginning of\nhis reign and durin 1812, but acted badly by giving a constitution to\nPoland, forming theHoly Alliance, entrusting power to Arakcheev,\nfavoring Golitsyn and myticism, and afterwards Shishkov and Photius. He\nalso acted badly by cocerning himself with the active army and\ndisbanding the Semenov regimet.\"\n\nIt would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the\nhstorians address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good for\numanity.\n\nWhat do these reproaches mean?\n\nDo not the very actions for hich the historians praise Alexander I (the\nliberal attempts at the beinning of his reign, his struggle with\nNapoleon, the firmness he displyed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813)\nflow from the same sources--the ircumstances of his birth, education,\nand life--that made his personalty what it was and from which the\nactions for which they blame him (th Holy Alliance, the restoration of\nPoland, and the reaction of 1820 an later) also flowed?\n\nIn what does the substance of those reproaches le?\n\nIt lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I,\nsanding on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the\nblindig light of history focused upon him; a character exposed to those\nstrogest of all influences: the intrigues, flattery, and self-deception\nineparable from power; a character who at every moment of his life felt\n responsibility for all that was happening in Europe; and not a\nfictitous but a live character who like every man had his personal\nhabits, pssions, and impulses toward goodness, beauty, and truth--that\nthis chaacter--though not lacking in virtue (the historians do not\naccuse him f that)--had not the same conception of the welfare of\nhumanity fifty ears ago as a present-day professor who from his youth\nupwards has bee occupied with learning: that is, with books and\nlectures and with takng notes from them.\n\nBut even if we assume that fifty years ago Alexaner I was mistaken in\nhis view of what was good for the people, we mustinevitably assume that\nthe historian who judges Alexander will also afer the lapse of some\ntime turn out to be mistaken in his view of what s good for humanity.\nThis assumption is all the more natural and ineviable because, watching\nthe movement of history, we see that every yearand with each new\nwriter, opinion as to what is good for mankind changs; so that what\nonce seemed good, ten years later seems bad, and vice ersa. And what is\nmore, we find at one and the same time quite contradctory views as to\nwhat is bad and what is good in history: some peopleregard giving a\nconstitution to Poland and forming the Holy Alliance a praiseworthy in\nAlexander, while others regard it as blameworthy.\n\nTh activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called useful or\nharmfl, for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful.\nIf tat activity displeases somebody, this is only because it does not\nagre with his limited understanding of what is good. Whether the\npreservaton of my father's house in Moscow, or the glory of the Russian\narms, o the prosperity of the Petersburg and other universities, or the\nfreedm of Poland or the greatness of Russia, or the balance of power in\nEurpe, or a certain kind of European culture called \"progress\" appear\nto e to be good or bad, I must admit that besides these things the\nactionof every historic character has other more general purposes\ninaccessibe to me.\n\nBut let us assume that what is called science can harmonize ll\ncontradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and badby\nwhich to try historic characters and events; let us say that Alexaner\ncould have done everything differently; let us say that with guidane\nfrom those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim ofthe\nmovement of humanity, he might have arranged matters according to he\nprogram his present accusers would have given him--of nationality,\nreedom, equality, and progress (these, I think, cover the ground). Letus assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated,and that Alexander had acted on it. What would then have become of theactivity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in\nhe government--an activity that in the opinion of the historians was\ngod and beneficent? Their activity would not have existed: there would\nave been no life, there would have been nothing.\n\nIf we admit that humn life can be ruled by reason, the possibility of\nlife is destroyed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIf we assume as the historians do that great men lead huanity to the\nattainment of certain ends--the greatness of Russia or ofFrance, the\nbalance of power in Europe, the diffusion of the ideas of he\nRevolution, general progress, or anything else--then it is impossibe to\nexplain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions f\nchance and genius.\n\nIf the aim of the European wars at the beginningof the nineteenth\ncentury had been the aggrandizement of Russia, that im might have been\naccomplished without all the preceding wars and witout the invasion. If\nthe aim was the aggrandizement of France, that miht have been attained\nwithout the Revolution and without the Empire. I the aim was the\ndissemination of ideas, the printing press could haveaccomplished that\nmuch better than warfare. If the aim was the progres of civilization,\nit is easy to see that there are other ways of diffuing civilization\nmore expedient than by the destruction of wealth and f human lives.\n\nWhy did it happen in this and not in some other way?\n\necause it happened so! \"Chance created the situation; genius utilized\nt,\" says history.\n\nBut what is chance? What is genius?\n\nThe words chane and genius do not denote any really existing thing and\ntherefore canot be defined. Those words only denote a certain stage of\nunderstandin of phenomena. I do not know why a certain event occurs; I\nthink that  cannot know it; so I do not try to know it and I talk about\nchance. Isee a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary\nhuman agences; I do not understand why this occurs and I talk of\ngenius.\n\nTo a hed of rams, the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a\nspecial encosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others\nmust seem tobe a genius. And it must appear an astonishing conjunction\nof genius wth a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram,\nwho instead f getting into the general fold every evening goes into a\nspecial enclsure where there are oats--that this very ram, swelling\nwith fat, is klled for meat.\n\nBut the rams need only cease to suppose that all that appens to them\nhappens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aim; they need only\nadmit that what happens to them may also have purpose beyond their ken,\nand they will at once perceive a unity and coherenc in what happened to\nthe ram that was fattened. Even if they do not knw for what purpose\nthey are fattened, they will at least know that allthat happened to the\nram did not happen accidentally, and will no longr need the conceptions\nof chance or genius.\n\nOnly by renouncing our clim to discern a purpose immediately\nintelligible to us, and admitting he ultimate purpose to be beyond our\nken, may we discern the sequence f experiences in the lives of historic\ncharacters and perceive the caue of the effect they produce\n(incommensurable with ordinary human capailities), and then the words\nchance and genius become superfluous.\n\nWeneed only confess that we do not know the purpose of the European\nconvlsions and that we know only the facts--that is, the murders, first\ninFrance, then in Italy, in Africa, in Prussia, in Austria, in Spain,\nan in Russia--and that the movements from the west to the east and from\nhe east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events, and\not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius inNapoleon and Alexander, but we shall be unable to consider them to be\nnything but like other men, and we shall not be obliged to have\nrecoure to chance for an explanation of those small events which made\nthese eople what they were, but it will be clear that all those small\neventswere inevitable.\n\nBy discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate prpose, we shall\nclearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blosom or seed for\nany single plant better suited to it than those it prouces, so it is\nimpossible to imagine any two people more completely adpted down to the\nsmallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill, han Napoleon and\nAlexander with all their antecedents.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\nThe fundamental and essential significance of the European events of he\nbeginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mas of\nthe European peoples from west to east and afterwards from east towest.\nThe commencement of that movement was the movement from west to ast.\nFor the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike moveent to\nMoscow it was necessary: (1) that they should form themselves ito a\nmilitary group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlke\nmilitary group of the east, (2) that they should abandon all establshed\ntraditions and customs, and (3) that during their military movemet they\nshould have at their head a man who could justify to himself an to them\nthe deceptions, robberies, and murders which would have to becommitted\nduring that movement.\n\nAnd beginning with the French Revoluton the old inadequately large\ngroup was destroyed, as well as the old abits and traditions, and step\nby step a group was formed of larger diensions with new customs and\ntraditions, and a man was produced who wold stand at the head of the\ncoming movement and bear the responsibilit for all that had to be done.\n\nA man without convictions, without habis, without traditions, without a\nname, and not even a Frenchman, emergs--by what seem the strangest\nchances--from among all the seething Frech parties, and without joining\nany one of them is borne forward to a rominent position.\n\nThe ignorance of his colleagues, the weakness and nsignificance of his\nopponents, the frankness of his falsehoods, and te dazzling and self-\nconfident limitations of this man raise him to th head of the army. The\nbrilliant qualities of the soldiers of the armysent to Italy, his\nopponents' reluctance to fight, and his own childis audacity and self-\nconfidence secure him military fame. Innumerable s-called chances\naccompany him everywhere. The disfavor into which he flls with the\nrulers of France turns to his advantage. His attempts to void his\npredestined path are unsuccessful: he is not received into th Russian\nservice, and the appointment he seeks in Turkey comes to nothng. During\nthe war in Italy he is several times on the verge of destrution and\neach time is saved in an unexpected manner. Owing to various iplomatic\nconsiderations the Russian armies--just those which might hae destroyed\nhis prestige--do not appear upon the scene till he is no lnger there.\n\nOn his return from Italy he finds the government in Parisin a process\nof dissolution in which all those who are in it are ineviably wiped out\nand destroyed. And by chance an escape from this dangerus position\npresents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless exedition to\nAfrica. Again so-called chance accompanies him. ImpregnableMalta\nsurrenders without a shot; his most reckless schemes are crownedwith\nsuccess. The enemy's fleet, which subsequently did not let a singe boat\npass, allows his entire army to elude it. In Africa a whole seres of\noutrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants. Ad the\nmen who commit these crimes, especially their leader, assure theselves\nthat this is admirable, this is glory--it resembles Caesar and lexander\nthe Great and is therefore good.\n\nThis ideal of glory and gradeur--which consists not merely in\nconsidering nothing wrong that one oes but in priding oneself on every\ncrime one commits, ascribing to itan incomprehensible supernatural\nsignificance--that ideal, destined toguide this man and his associates,\nhad scope for its development in Afica. Whatever he does succeeds. The\nplague does not touch him. The crulty of murdering prisoners is not\nimputed to him as a fault. His childshly rash, uncalled-for, and\nignoble departure from Africa, leaving hi comrades in distress, is set\ndown to his credit, and again the enemy' fleet twice lets him slip\npast. When, intoxicated by the crimes he ha committed so successfully,\nhe reaches Paris, the dissolution of the rpublican government, which a\nyear earlier might have ruined him, has rached its extreme limit, and\nhis presence there now as a newcomer freefrom party entanglements can\nonly serve to exalt him--and though he hiself has no plan, he is quite\nready for his new role.\n\nHe had no plan,he was afraid of everything, but the parties snatched at\nhim and demaned his participation.\n\nHe alone--with his ideal of glory and grandeur eveloped in Italy and\nEgypt, his insane self-adulation, his boldness i crime and frankness in\nlying--he alone could justify what had to be dne.\n\nHe is needed for the place that awaits him, and so almost apart fom his\nwill and despite his indecision, his lack of a plan, and all hi\nmistakes, he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power an\nthe conspiracy is crowned with success.\n\nHe is pushed into a meeting f the legislature. In alarm he wishes to\nflee, considering himself los. He pretends to fall into a swoon and\nsays senseless things that shoud have ruined him. But the once proud\nand shrewd rulers of France, feeing that their part is played out, are\neven more bewildered than he, ad do not say the words they should have\nsaid to destroy him and retaintheir power.\n\nChance, millions of chances, give him power, and all menas if by\nagreement co-operate to confirm that power. Chance forms the haracters\nof the rulers of France, who submit to him; chance forms thecharacter\nof Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government; chance cotrives a\nplot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirm his\npower. Chance puts the Duc d'Enghien in his hands and unexpectedl\ncauses him to kill him--thereby convincing the mob more forcibly thanin\nany other way that he had the right, since he had the might. Chancecontrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an\nexpediton against England (which would inevitably have ruined him) he\nnever crries out that intention, but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and\nthe Ausrians, who surrender without a battle. Chance and genius give\nhim the ictory at Austerlitz; and by chance all men, not only the\nFrench but al Europe--except England which does not take part in the\nevents about o happen--despite their former horror and detestation of\nhis crimes, nw recognize his authority, the title he has given himself,\nand his idel of grandeur and glory, which seems excellent and\nreasonable to them ll.\n\nAs if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement,the\nwestern forces push toward the east several times in 1805, 1806, 107,\nand 1809, gaining strength and growing. In 1811 the group of peopl that\nhad formed in France unites into one group with the peoples of Cntral\nEurope. The strength of the justification of the man who stands t the\nhead of the movement grows with the increased size of the group.During\nthe ten-year preparatory period this man had formed relations wth all\nthe crowned heads of Europe. The discredited rulers of the worl can\noppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate Napoleonic ideal of gory\nand grandeur. One after another they hasten to display their\ninsigificance before him. The King of Prussia sends his wife to seek\nthe grat man's mercy; the Emperor of Austria considers it a favor that\nthis an receives a daughter of the Caesars into his bed; the Pope, the\nguarian of all that the nations hold sacred, utilizes religion for the\naggandizement of the great man. It is not Napoleon who prepares himself\nfr the accomplishment of his role, so much as all those round him who\npepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is\nhappning and has to happen. There is no step, no crime or petty fraud\nhe cmmits, which in the mouths of those around him is not at once\nrepresened as a great deed. The most suitable fete the Germans can\ndevise for im is a celebration of Jena and Auerstadt. Not only is he\ngreat, but s are his ancestors, his brothers, his stepsons, and his\nbrothers-in-la. Everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his\nreason and t prepare him for his terrible part. And when he is ready so\ntoo are th forces.\n\nThe invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal--Mosow. That\ncity is taken; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than te opposing\narmies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz to Waram. But\nsuddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitheto had so\nconsistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successesto the\npredestined goal, an innumerable sequence of inverse chances ocur--from\nthe cold in his head at Borodino to the sparks which set Moscw on fire,\nand the frosts--and instead of genius, stupidity and immeasrable\nbaseness become evident.\n\nThe invaders flee, turn back, flee agan, and all the chances are now\nnot for Napoleon but always against him\n\nA countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a\nremakable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east.\nAttemptd drives from east to west--similar to the contrary movements of\n1805,1807, and 1809--precede the great westward movement; there is the\nsamecoalescence into a group of enormous dimensions; the same adhesion\nof he people of Central Europe to the movement; the same hesitation\nmidwa, and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached.\n\nParis, he ultimate goal, is reached. The Napoleonic government and army\nare dstroyed. Napoleon himself is no longer of any account; all his\nactionsare evidently pitiful and mean, but again an inexplicable chance\noccur. The allies detest Napoleon whom they regard as the cause of\ntheir suferings. Deprived of power and authority, his crimes and his\ncraft expsed, he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten\nyears previosly and one year later--an outlawed brigand. But by some\nstrange chanc no one perceives this. His part is not yet ended. The man\nwho ten yeas before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand\nis sent t an island two days' sail from France, which for some reason\nis presened to him as his dominion, and guards are given to him and\nmillions ofmoney are paid him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe flood of nations begins to subide into its normal channels. The\nwaves of the great movement abate, ad on the calm surface eddies are\nformed in which float the diplomatist, who imagine that they have\ncaused the floods to abate.\n\nBut the smooh sea again suddenly becomes disturbed. The diplomatists\nthink that thir disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure of\nnatural force; they anticipate war between their sovereigns; the\nposition seems to hem insoluble. But the wave they feel to be rising\ndoes not come from he quarter they expect. It rises again from the same\npoint as before--aris. The last backwash of the movement from the west\noccurs: a backwah which serves to solve the apparently insuperable\ndiplomatic difficulies and ends the military movement of that period of\nhistory.\n\nThe manwho had devastated France returns to France alone, without any\nconspircy and without soldiers. Any guard might arrest him, but by\nstrange chnce no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they\ncursed the dy before and will curse again a month later.\n\nThis man is still neededto justify the final collective act.\n\nThat act is performed.\n\nThe lastrole is played. The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his\npowderand paint: he will not be wanted any more.\n\nAnd some years pass duringwhich he plays a pitiful comedy to himself in\nsolitude on his island, ustifying his actions by intrigues and lies\nwhen the justification is o longer needed, and displaying to the whole\nworld what it was that peple had mistaken for strength as long as an\nunseen hand directed his ations.\n\nThe manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped te actor\nshows him to us.\n\n\"See what you believed in! This is he! Do yo now see that it was not he\nbut I who moved you?\"\n\nBut dazed by the foce of the movement, it was long before people\nunderstood this.\n\nStill reater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of\nAlexander I,the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from\neast to west\n\nWhat was needed for him who, overshadowing others, stood at the headof\nthat movement from east to west?\n\nWhat was needed was a sense of jutice and a sympathy with European\naffairs, but a remote sympathy not dlled by petty interests; a moral\nsuperiority over those sovereigns of he day who co-operated with him; a\nmild and attractive personality; an a personal grievance against\nNapoleon. And all this was found in Alexnder I; all this had been\nprepared by innumerable so-called chances inhis life: his education,\nhis early liberalism, the advisers who surrouded him, and by\nAusterlitz, and Tilsit, and Erfurt.\n\nDuring the nationl war he was inactive because he was not needed. But\nas soon as the neessity for a general European war presented itself he\nappeared in his lace at the given moment and, uniting the nations of\nEurope, led them o the goal.\n\nThe goal is reached. After the final war of 1815 Alexande possesses all\npossible power. How does he use it?\n\nAlexander I--the pcifier of Europe, the man who from his early years\nhad striven only fo his people's welfare, the originator of the liberal\ninnovations in hi fatherland--now that he seemed to possess the utmost\npower and therefre to have the possibility of bringing about the\nwelfare of his people--at the time when Napoleon in exile was drawing\nup childish and mendaious plans of how he would have made mankind happy\nhad he retained powr--Alexander I, having fulfilled his mission and\nfeeling the hand of Gd upon him, suddenly recognizes the insignificance\nof that supposed poer, turns away from it, and gives it into the hands\nof contemptible me whom he despises, saying only:\n\n\"Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Ty Name!... I too am a man like the\nrest of you. Let me live like a manand think of my soul and of God.\"\n\nAs the sun and each atom of ether i a sphere complete in itself, and\nyet at the same time only a part of  whole too immense for man to\ncomprehend, so each individual has withi himself his own aims and yet\nhas them to serve a general purpose incoprehensible to man.\n\nA bee settling on a flower has stung a child. Andthe child is afraid of\nbees and declares that bees exist to sting peope. A poet admires the\nbee sucking from the chalice of a flower and say it exists to suck the\nfragrance of flowers. A beekeeper, seeing the be collect pollen from\nflowers and carry it to the hive, says that it eists to gather honey.\nAnother beekeeper who has studied the life of th hive more closely says\nthat the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the yung bees and rear a\nqueen, and that it exists to perpetuate its race.  botanist notices\nthat the bee flying with the pollen of a male flowerto a pistil\nfertilizes the latter, and sees in this the purpose of thebee's\nexistence. Another, observing the migration of plants, notices tat the\nbee helps in this work, and may say that in this lies the purpoe of the\nbee. But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by he first,\nthe second, or any of the processes the human mind can discen. The\nhigher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purpses, the\nmore obvious it becomes, that the ultimate purpose is beyond ur\ncomprehension.\n\nAll that is accessible to man is the relation of th life of the bee to\nother manifestations of life. And so it is with th purpose of historic\ncharacters and nations.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nNatasha's edding to Bezukhov, which took place in 1813, was the last\nhappy eventin the family of the old Rostovs. Count Ilya Rostov died\nthat same yea and, as always happens, after the father's death the\nfamily group broe up.\n\nThe events of the previous year: the burning of Moscow and the light\nfrom it, the death of Prince Andrew, Natasha's despair, Petya's eath,\nand the old countess' grief fell blow after blow on the old coun's\nhead. He seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all theseevents, and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting an\ninviting further blows which would finish him. He seemed now frightend\nand distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising.\n\nThe arangements for Natasha's marriage occupied him for a while. He\nordereddinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful, but\nhis cherfulness was not infectious as it used to be: on the contrary it\nevokd the compassion of those who knew and liked him.\n\nWhen Pierre and hiswife had left, he grew very quiet and began to\ncomplain of depression.A few days later he fell ill and took to his\nbed. He realized from thefirst that he would not get up again, despite\nthe doctor's encouragemet. The countess passed a fortnight in an\narmchair by his pillow withou undressing. Every time she gave him his\nmedicine he sobbed and silenty kissed her hand. On his last day,\nsobbing, he asked her and his abset son to forgive him for having\ndissipated their property--that being he chief fault of which he was\nconscious. After receiving communion an unction he quietly died; and\nnext day a throng of acquaintances who cme to pay their last respects\nto the deceased filled the house rented y the Rostovs. All these\nacquaintances, who had so often dined and daned at his house and had so\noften laughed at him, now said, with a commn feeling of self-reproach\nand emotion, as if justifying themselves: \"ell, whatever he may have\nbeen he was a most worthy man. You don't mee such men nowadays.... And\nwhich of us has not weaknesses of his own?\"\nIt was just when the count's affairs had become so involved that it ws\nimpossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that heunexpectedly died.\n\nNicholas was with the Russian army in Paris when te news of his\nfather's death reached him. He at once resigned his commssion, and\nwithout waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absenceand went to\nMoscow. The state of the count's affairs became quite obvius a month\nafter his death, surprising everyone by the immense total o small debts\nthe existence of which no one had suspected. The debts amunted to\ndouble the value of the property.\n\nFriends and relations advied Nicholas to decline the inheritance. But\nhe regarded such a refusalas a slur on his father's memory, which he\nheld sacred, and therefore ould not hear of refusing and accepted the\ninheritance together with te obligation to pay the debts.\n\nThe creditors who had so long been silnt, restrained by a vague but\npowerful influence exerted on them whilehe lived by the count's\ncareless good nature, all proceeded to enforcetheir claims at once. As\nalways happens in such cases rivalry sprang u as to which should get\npaid first, and those who like Mitenka held prmissory notes given them\nas presents now became the most exacting of te creditors. Nicholas was\nallowed no respite and no peace, and those wo had seemed to pity the\nold man--the cause of their losses (if they wre losses)--now\nremorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntariy undertaken the\ndebts and was obviously not guilty of contracting the.\n\nNot one of the plans Nicholas tried succeeded; the estate was sold y\nauction for half its value, and half the debts still remained unpaid\nNicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his brother-i-\nlaw Bezukhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due for valuereceived. And to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder, as the\ncredtors threatened, he re-entered the government service.\n\nHe could not rjoin the army where he would have been made colonel at\nthe next vacanc, for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on\nlife; and so despte his reluctance to remain in Moscow among people who\nhad known him bfore, and despite his abhorrence of the civil service,\nhe accepted a pst in Moscow in that service, doffed the uniform of\nwhich he was so fod, and moved with his mother and Sonya to a small\nhouse on the SivtsevVrazhek.\n\nNatasha and Pierre were living in Petersburg at the time andhad no\nclear idea of Nicholas' circumstances. Having borrowed money frm his\nbrother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition frm him.\nHis position was the more difficult because with his salary of welve\nhundred rubles he had not only to keep himself, his mother, and onya,\nbut had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty. Th\ncountess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions he\nhad been used to from childhood and, unable to realize how hard it as\nfor her son, kept demanding now a carriage (which they did not keep to\nsend for a friend, now some expensive article of food for herself,or\nwine for her son, or money to buy a present as a surprise for Natasa or\nSonya, or for Nicholas himself.\n\nSonya kept house, attended on he aunt, read to her, put up with her\nwhims and secret ill-will, and heled Nicholas to conceal their poverty\nfrom the old countess. Nicholas flt himself irredeemably indebted to\nSonya for all she was doing for hi mother and greatly admired her\npatience and devotion, but tried to kep aloof from her.\n\nHe seemed in his heart to reproach her for being to perfect, and\nbecause there was nothing to reproach her with. She had ll that people\nare valued for, but little that could have made him lov her. He felt\nthat the more he valued her the less he loved her. He ha taken her at\nher word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now bhaved as if all\nthat had passed between them had been long forgotten ad could never in\nany case be renewed.\n\nNicholas' position became worseand worse. The idea of putting something\naside out of his salary prove a dream. Not only did he not save\nanything, but to comply with his moher's demands he even incurred some\nsmall debts. He could see no way ot of this situation. The idea of\nmarrying some rich woman, which was sggested to him by his female\nrelations, was repugnant to him. The othe way out--his mother's death--\nnever entered his head. He wished for nthing and hoped for nothing, and\ndeep in his heart experienced a gloom and stern satisfaction in an\nuncomplaining endurance of his position.He tried to avoid his old\nacquaintances with their commiseration and ofensive offers of\nassistance; he avoided all distraction and recreatio, and even at home\ndid nothing but play cards with his mother, pace siently up and down\nthe room, and smoke one pipe after another. He seeme carefully to\ncherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabld him to endure\nhis position.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAt the beginning of wintr Princess Mary came to Moscow. From reports\ncurrent in town she learnd how the Rostovs were situated, and how \"the\nson has sacrificed himsef for his mother,\" as people were saying.\n\n\"I never expected anything lse of him,\" said Princess Mary to herself,\nfeeling a joyous sense of er love for him. Remembering her friendly\nrelations with all the Rostos which had made her almost a member of the\nfamily, she thought it herduty to go to see them. But remembering her\nrelations with Nicholas inVoronezh she was shy about doing so. Making a\ngreat effort she did howver go to call on them a few weeks after her\narrival in Moscow.\n\nNichoas was the first to meet her, as the countess' room could only be\nreaced through his. But instead of being greeted with pleasure as she\nhad xpected, at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold, stiff,\nprud expression she had not seen on it before. He inquired about her\nheath, led the way to his mother, and having sat there for five minutes\nlft the room.\n\nWhen the princess came out of the countess' room Nichola met her again,\nand with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied he to the anteroom.\nTo her remarks about his mother's health he made no eply. \"What's that\nto you? Leave me in peace,\" his looks seemed to say\n\n\"Why does she come prowling here? What does she want? I can't bear tese\nladies and all these civilities!\" said he aloud in Sonya's presenc,\nevidently unable to repress his vexation, after the princess' carriae\nhad disappeared.\n\n\"Oh, Nicholas, how can you talk like that?\" cried onya, hardly able to\nconceal her delight. \"She is so kind and Mamma isso fond of her!\"\n\nNicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking o the princess any\nmore. But after her visit the old countess spoke of er several times a\nday.\n\nShe sang her praises, insisted that her son mst call on her, expressed\na wish to see her often, but yet always becae ill-humored when she\nbegan to talk about her.\n\nNicholas tried to kee silence when his mother spoke of the princess,\nbut his silence irritaed her.\n\n\"She is a very admirable and excellent young woman,\" said she \"and you\nmust go and call on her. You would at least be seeing someboy, and I\nthink it must be dull for you only seeing us.\"\n\n\"But I don't n the least want to, Mamma.\"\n\n\"You used to want to, and now you don't.Really I don't understand you,\nmy dear. One day you are dull, and the ext you refuse to see anyone.\"\n\n\"But I never said I was dull.\"\n\n\"Why, ou said yourself you don't want even to see her. She is a very\nadmirabe young woman and you always liked her, but now suddenly you\nhave got ome notion or other in your head. You hide everything from\nme.\"\n\n\"Not t all, Mamma.\"\n\n\"If I were asking you to do something disagreeable now-but I only ask\nyou to return a call. One would think mere politeness equired it....\nWell, I have asked you, and now I won't interfere any mre since you\nhave secrets from your mother.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I'll go if ou wish it.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter to me. I only wish it for your sake.\"\nNicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid out the cards for a\npatiece, trying to divert his mother's attention to another topic.\n\nThe sam conversation was repeated next day and the day after, and the\nday aftr that.\n\nAfter her visit to the Rostovs and her unexpectedly chilly reeption by\nNicholas, Princess Mary confessed to herself that she had ben right in\nnot wishing to be the first to call.\n\n\"I expected nothing ese,\" she told herself, calling her pride to her\naid. \"I have nothing t do with him and I only wanted to see the old\nlady, who was always kin to me and to whom I am under many\nobligations.\"\n\nBut she could not paify herself with these reflections; a feeling akin\nto remorse troubledher when she thought of her visit. Though she had\nfirmly resolved not o call on the Rostovs again and to forget the whole\nmatter, she felt hrself all the time in an awkward position. And when\nshe asked herself hat distressed her, she had to admit that it was her\nrelation to Rosto. His cold, polite manner did not express his feeling\nfor her (she kne that) but it concealed something, and until she could\ndiscover what tat something was, she felt that she could not be at\nease.\n\nOne day in idwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her\nnephew's lessns, she was informed that Rostov had called. With a firm\nresolution no to betray herself and not show her agitation, she sent\nfor Mademoisele Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room.\n\nHer first glance a Nicholas' face told her that he had only come to\nfulfill the demands f politeness, and she firmly resolved to maintain\nthe tone in which headdressed her.\n\nThey spoke of the countess' health, of their mutual frends, of the\nlatest war news, and when the ten minutes required by proriety had\nelapsed after which a visitor may rise, Nicholas got up to sy good-by.\n\nWith Mademoiselle Bourienne's help the princess had maintaned the\nconversation very well, but at the very last moment, just whenhe rose,\nshe was so tired of talking of what did not interest her, andher mind\nwas so full of the question why she alone was granted so litte\nhappiness in life, that in a fit of absent-mindedness she sat still,her\nluminous eyes gazing fixedly before her, not noticing that he had isen.\n\nNicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice he\nabstraction, made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then agai\nlooked at the princess. She still sat motionless with a look of\nsuffeing on her gentle face. He suddenly felt sorry for her and was\nvaguelyconscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face\nexpressed He wished to help her and say something pleasant, but could\nthink of othing to say.\n\n\"Good-bye, Princess!\" said he.\n\nShe started, flushed, nd sighed deeply.\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon,\" she said as if waking up. Are you going\nalready, Count? Well then, good-by! Oh, but the cushion or the\ncountess!\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, I'll fetch it,\" said Mademoiselle Burienne, and she\nleft the room.\n\nThey both sat silent, with an occasioal glance at one another.\n\n\"Yes, Princess,\" said Nicholas at last witha sad smile, \"it doesn't\nseem long ago since we first met at Bogucharoo, but how much water has\nflowed since then! In what distress we all semed to be then, yet I\nwould give much to bring back that time... but here's no bringing it\nback.\"\n\nPrincess Mary gazed intently into his eys with her own luminous ones as\nhe said this. She seemed to be trying o fathom the hidden meaning of\nhis words which would explain his feelig for her.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said she, \"but you have no reason to regret th past, Count.\nAs I understand your present life, I think you will alwas recall it\nwith satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that fills i now...\"\n\n\"I cannot accept your praise,\" he interrupted her hurriedly.\"On the\ncontrary I continually reproach myself.... But this is not at ll an\ninteresting or cheerful subject.\"\n\nHis face again resumed its fomer stiff and cold expression. But the\nprincess had caught a glimpse o the man she had known and loved, and it\nwas to him that she now spoke\n\n\"I thought you would allow me to tell you this,\" she said. \"I had coe\nso near to you... and to all your family that I thought you would no\nconsider my sympathy misplaced, but I was mistaken,\" and suddenly hervoice trembled. \"I don't know why,\" she continued, recovering herself,\"but you used to be different, and...\"\n\n\"There are a thousand reasons hy,\" laying special emphasis on the why.\n\"Thank you, Princess,\" he addd softly. \"Sometimes it is hard.\"\n\n\"So that's why! That's why!\" a voic whispered in Princess Mary's soul.\n\"No, it was not only that gay, kin, and frank look, not only that\nhandsome exterior, that I loved in him I divined his noble, resolute,\nself-sacrificing spirit too,\" she saidto herself. \"Yes, he is poor now\nand I am rich.... Yes, that's the onl reason.... Yes, were it not for\nthat...\" And remembering his former tnderness, and looking now at his\nkind, sorrowful face, she suddenly unerstood the cause of his coldness.\n\n\"But why, Count, why?\" she almost ried, unconsciously moving closer to\nhim. \"Why? Tell me. You must tellme!\"\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\"I don't understand your why, Count,\" she contined, \"but it's hard for\nme... I confess it. For some reason you wish todeprive me of our former\nfriendship. And that hurts me.\" There were ters in her eyes and in her\nvoice. \"I have had so little happiness in lie that every loss is hard\nfor me to bear.... Excuse me, good-by!\" and uddenly she began to cry\nand was hurrying from the room.\n\n\"Princess, fr God's sake!\" he exclaimed, trying to stop her.\n\"Princess!\"\n\nShe turnd round. For a few seconds they gazed silently into one\nanother's eyes-and what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly\nbecame possible, ievitable, and very near.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nIn the winter of 1813 Nichols married Princess Mary and moved to Bald\nHills with his wife, his moter, and Sonya.\n\nWithin four years he had paid off all his remaining dets without\nselling any of his wife's property, and having received a sall\ninheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to Pierre aswell.\n\nIn another three years, by 1820, he had so managed his affairs hat he\nwas able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was negtiating\nto buy back Otradnoe--that being his pet dream.\n\nHaving starte farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted to it\nthat it became is favorite and almost his sole occupation. Nicholas was\na plain farme: he did not like innovations, especially the English ones\nthen cominginto vogue. He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate\nmanagement, isliked factories, the raising of expensive products, and\nthe buying o expensive seed corn, and did not make a hobby of any\nparticular part f the work on his estate. He always had before his\nmind's eye the estae as a whole and not any particular part of it. The\nchief thing in hiseyes was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen\nin the air, nor anures, nor special plows, but that most important\nagent by which nitrgen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made effective--\nthe peasant labore. When Nicholas first began farming and began to\nunderstand its differnt branches, it was the serf who especially\nattracted his attention. Te peasant seemed to him not merely a tool,\nbut also a judge of farmingand an end in himself. At first he watched\nthe serfs, trying to undersand their aims and what they considered good\nand bad, and only pretendd to direct them and give orders while in\nreality learning from them teir methods, their manner of speech, and\ntheir judgment of what was god and bad. Only when he had understood the\npeasants' tastes and aspiraions, had learned to talk their language, to\ngrasp the hidden meaning f their words, and felt akin to them did he\nbegin boldly to manage hisserfs, that is, to perform toward them the\nduties demanded of him. AndNicholas' management produced very brilliant\nresults.\n\nGuided by some ift of insight, on taking up the management of the\nestates he at once nerringly appointed as bailiff, village elder, and\ndelegate, the very en the serfs would themselves have chosen had they\nhad the right to chose, and these posts never changed hands. Before\nanalyzing the propertes of manure, before entering into the debit and\ncredit (as he ironicaly called it), he found out how many cattle the\npeasants had and incresed the number by all possible means. He kept the\npeasant families togther in the largest groups possible, not allowing\nthe family groups todivide into separate households. He was hard alike\non the lazy, the deraved, and the weak, and tried to get them expelled\nfrom the commune.\nHe was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants' hay and\ncrn as of his own, and few landowners had their crops sown and\nharveste so early and so well, or got so good a return, as did\nNicholas.\n\nHe dsliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs--the \"drones\"\nas e called them--and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity. When\nadecision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf, especially if one\nad to be punished, he always felt undecided and consulted everybody inthe house; but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripte\ninstead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation. He\nnver felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants. He knew that hisevery decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions.\nHe did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man, or to\nake things easy for or reward anyone, merely because he felt inclined\no do so. He could not have said by what standard he judged what he\nshold or should not do, but the standard was quite firm and definite in\nhs own mind.\n\nOften, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregulaity, he would\nsay: \"What can one do with our Russian peasants?\" and imgined that he\ncould not bear them.\n\nYet he loved \"our Russian peasants and their way of life with his whole\nsoul, and for that very reason hd understood and assimilated the one\nway and manner of farming which poduced good results.\n\nCountess Mary was jealous of this passion of herhusband's and regretted\nthat she could not share it; but she could notunderstand the joys and\nvexations he derived from that world, to her s remote and alien. She\ncould not understand why he was so particularlyanimated and happy when,\nafter getting up at daybreak and spending thewhole morning in the\nfields or on the threshing floor, he returned fro the sowing or mowing\nor reaping to have tea with her. She did not undrstand why he spoke\nwith such admiration and delight of the farming ofthe thrifty and well-\nto-do peasant Matthew Ermishin, who with his famly had carted corn all\nnight; or of the fact that his (Nicholas') sheaes were already stacked\nbefore anyone else had his harvest in. She didnot understand why he\nstepped out from the window to the veranda and siled under his mustache\nand winked so joyfully, when warm steady rain egan to fall on the dry\nand thirsty shoots of the young oats, or why wen the wind carried away\na threatening cloud during the hay harvest hewould return from the\nbarn, flushed, sunburned, and perspiring, with asmell of wormwood and\ngentian in his hair and, gleefully rubbing his hnds, would say: \"Well,\none more day and my grain and the peasants' wil all be under cover.\"\n\nStill less did she understand why he, kindheartd and always ready to\nanticipate her wishes, should become almost desprate when she brought\nhim a petition from some peasant men or women wh had appealed to her to\nbe excused some work; why he, that kind Nichols, should obstinately\nrefuse her, angrily asking her not to interfere n what was not her\nbusiness. She felt he had a world apart, which he lved passionately and\nwhich had laws she had not fathomed.\n\nSometimes wen, trying to understand him, she spoke of the good work he\nwas doing or his serfs, he would be vexed and reply: \"Not in the least;\nit neverentered my head and I wouldn't do that for their good! That's\nall poety and old wives' talk--all that doing good to one's neighbor!\nWhat I wnt is that our children should not have to go begging. I must\nput our ffairs in order while I am alive, that's all. And to do that,\norder an strictness are essential.... That's all about it!\" said he,\nclenchinghis vigorous fist. \"And fairness, of course,\" he added, \"for\nif the pesant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse, he\ncan do n good either for himself or for me.\"\n\nAnd all Nicholas did was fruitfu--probably just because he refused to\nallow himself to think that he ws doing good to others for virtue's\nsake. His means increased rapidly;serfs from neighboring estates came\nto beg him to buy them, and long ater his death the memory of his\nadministration was devoutly preserved mong the serfs. \"He was a\nmaster... the peasants' affairs first and thn his own. Of course he was\nnot to be trifled with either--in a word, e was a real master!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOne matter connected with his anagement sometimes worried Nicholas, and\nthat was his quick temper toether with his old hussar habit of making\nfree use of his fists. At fist he saw nothing reprehensible in this,\nbut in the second year of hismarriage his view of that form of\npunishment suddenly changed.\n\nOnce i summer he had sent for the village elder from Bogucharovo, a man\nwho ad succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused of\ndishonety and various irregularities. Nicholas went out into the porch\nto quetion him, and immediately after the elder had given a few replies\nthe ound of cries and blows were heard. On returning to lunch Nicholas\nwen up to his wife, who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery\nfrme, and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that\nmorning Among other things he spoke of the Bogucharovo elder. Countess\nMary trned red and then pale, but continued to sit with head bowed and\nlips ompressed and gave her husband no reply.\n\n\"Such an insolent scoundrel! he cried, growing hot again at the mere\nrecollection of him. \"If he hd told me he was drunk and did not see...\nBut what is the matter with ou, Mary?\" he suddenly asked.\n\nCountess Mary raised her head and triedto speak, but hastily looked\ndown again and her lips puckered.\n\n\"Why, hatever is the matter, my dearest?\"\n\nThe looks of the plain Countess Mry always improved when she was in\ntears. She never cried from pain orvexation, but always from sorrow or\npity, and when she wept her radian eyes acquired an irresistible charm.\n\nThe moment Nicholas took her had she could no longer restrain herself\nand began to cry.\n\n\"Nicholas, Isaw it... he was to blame, but why do you... Nicholas!\" and\nshe covere her face with her hands.\n\nNicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, eft her side, and paced up\nand down the room. He understood what she ws weeping about, but could\nnot in his heart at once agree with her tha what he had regarded from\nchildhood as quite an everyday event was wrng. \"Is it just\nsentimentality, old wives' tales, or is she right?\" heasked himself.\nBefore he had solved that point he glanced again at herface filled with\nlove and pain, and he suddenly realized that she was ight and that he\nhad long been sinning against himself.\n\n\"Mary,\" he sad softly, going up to her, \"it will never happen again; I\ngive you my ord. Never,\" he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy\nasking for fogiveness.\n\nThe tears flowed faster still from the countess' eyes. She ook his hand\nand kissed it.\n\n\"Nicholas, when did you break your cameo? she asked to change the\nsubject, looking at his finger on which he woe a ring with a cameo of\nLaocoon's head.\n\n\"Today--it was the same affar. Oh, Mary, don't remind me of it!\" and\nagain he flushed. \"I give youmy word of honor it shan't occur again,\nand let this always be a reminer to me,\" and he pointed to the broken\nring.\n\nAfter that, when in disussions with his village elders or stewards the\nblood rushed to his fae and his fists began to clench, Nicholas would\nturn the broken ring o his finger and would drop his eyes before the\nman who was making him ngry. But he did forget himself once or twice\nwithin a twelvemonth, an then he would go and confess to his wife, and\nwould again promise tha this should really be the very last time.\n\n\"Mary, you must despise me\" he would say. \"I deserve it.\"\n\n\"You should go, go away at once, if yu don't feel strong enough to\ncontrol yourself,\" she would reply sadly trying to comfort her husband.\n\nAmong the gentry of the province Nichlas was respected but not liked.\nHe did not concern himself with the iterests of his own class, and\nconsequently some thought him proud and thers thought him stupid. The\nwhole summer, from spring sowing to harvst, he was busy with the work\non his farm. In autumn he gave himself u to hunting with the same\nbusiness-like seriousness--leaving home for  month, or even two, with\nhis hunt. In winter he visited his other vilages or spent his time\nreading. The books he read were chiefly historial, and on these he\nspent a certain sum every year. He was collecting,as he said, a serious\nlibrary, and he made it a rule to read through al the books he bought.\nHe would sit in his study with a grave air, reaing--a task he first\nimposed upon himself as a duty, but which afterwads became a habit\naffording him a special kind of pleasure and a conscousness of being\noccupied with serious matters. In winter, except for usiness\nexcursions, he spent most of his time at home making himself oe with\nhis family and entering into all the details of his children's elations\nwith their mother. The harmony between him and his wife grew loser and\ncloser and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in er.\n\nFrom the time of his marriage Sonya had lived in his house. Befor that,\nNicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself nd\nSonya, blaming himself and commending her. He had asked Princess May to\nbe gentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly realized the wrog he\nhad done Sonya, felt herself to blame toward her, and imagined tht her\nwealth had influenced Nicholas' choice. She could not find faultwith\nSonya in any way and tried to be fond of her, but often felt ill-ill\ntoward her which she could not overcome.\n\nOnce she had a talk withher friend Natasha about Sonya and about her\nown injustice toward her.\n\"You know,\" said Natasha, \"you have read the Gospels a great deal--thre\nis a passage in them that just fits Sonya.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked CountessMary, surprised.\n\n\"'To him that hath shall be given, and from him thathath not shall be\ntaken away.' You remember? She is one that hath not;why, I don't know.\nPerhaps she lacks egotism, I don't know, but from hr is taken away, and\neverything has been taken away. Sometimes I am dradfully sorry for her.\nFormerly I very much wanted Nicholas to marry hr, but I always had a\nsort of presentiment that it would not come off.She is a sterile\nflower, you know--like some strawberry blossoms. Someimes I am sorry\nfor her, and sometimes I think she doesn't feel it as ou or I would.\"\n\nThough Countess Mary told Natasha that those words inthe Gospel must be\nunderstood differently, yet looking at Sonya she ageed with Natasha's\nexplanation. It really seemed that Sonya did not fel her position\ntrying, and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a terile flower.\nShe seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of he family as a\nwhole. Like a cat, she had attached herself not to the eople but to the\nhome. She waited on the old countess, petted and spoied the children,\nwas always ready to render the small services for whih she had a gift,\nand all this was unconsciously accepted from her wit insufficient\ngratitude.\n\nThe country seat at Bald Hills had been rebult, though not on the same\nscale as under the old prince.\n\nThe buildins, begun under straitened circumstances, were more than\nsimple. The imense house on the old stone foundations was of wood,\nplastered only inide. It had bare deal floors and was furnished with\nvery simple hard sfas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made by their own\nserf carpenters ot of their own birchwood. The house was spacious and\nhad rooms for thehouse serfs and apartments for visitors. Whole\nfamilies of the Rostovs and Bolkonskis' relations sometimes came to\nBald Hills with sixteen hrses and dozens of servants and stayed for\nmonths. Besides that, four imes a year, on the name days and birthdays\nof the hosts, as many as ahundred visitors would gather there for a day\nor two. The rest of the ear life pursued its unbroken routine with its\nordinary occupations, ad its breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and suppers,\nprovided out of the poduce of the estate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nIt was the eve of St. Nicholas, te fifth of December, 1820. Natasha had\nbeen staying at her brother's wth her husband and children since early\nautumn. Pierre had gone to Petrsburg on business of his own for three\nweeks as he said, but had remaned there nearly seven weeks and was\nexpected back every minute.\n\nBesies the Bezukhov family, Nicholas' old friend the retired General\nVasil Dmitrich Denisov was staying with the Rostovs this fifth of\nDecember.\nOn the sixth, which was his name day when the house would be full of\nisitors, Nicholas knew he would have to exchange his Tartar tunic for \ntail coat, and put on narrow boots with pointed toes, and drive to th\nnew church he had built, and then receive visitors who would come to\nongratulate him, offer them refreshments, and talk about the electionsof the nobility; but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve o\nthat day in his usual way. He examined the bailiff's accounts of the\nillage in Ryazan which belonged to his wife's nephew, wrote two\nbusines letters, and walked over to the granaries, cattle yards and\nstables efore dinner. Having taken precautions against the general\ndrunkennessto be expected on the morrow because it was a great saint's\nday, he reurned to dinner, and without having time for a private talk\nwith his wfe sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons, at\nwhich the whle household had assembled. At that table were his mother,\nhis mother' old lady companion Belova, his wife, their three children\nwith their overness and tutor, his wife's nephew with his tutor, Sonya,\nDenisov, atasha, her three children, their governess, and old Michael\nIvanovich the late prince's architect, who was living on in retirement\nat Bald ills.\n\nCountess Mary sat at the other end of the table. When her husbad took\nhis place she concluded, from the rapid manner in which after tking up\nhis table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass staning\nbefore him, that he was out of humor, as was sometimes the case whn he\ncame in to dinner straight from the farm--especially before the sup.\nCountess Mary well knew that mood of his, and when she herself wasin a\ngood frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and thn\nbegan to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for is\nill-humor. But today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he shold\nbe angry with her without any reason, and she felt unhappy. She askd\nhim where he had been. He replied. She again inquired whether everyting\nwas going well on the farm. Her unnatural tone made him wince\nunplasantly and he replied hastily.\n\n\"Then I'm not mistaken,\" thought Couness Mary. \"Why is he cross with\nme?\" She concluded from his tone that e was vexed with her and wished\nto end the conversation. She knew her emarks sounded unnatural, but\ncould not refrain from asking some more uestions.\n\nThanks to Denisov the conversation at table soon became genral and\nlively, and she did not talk to her husband. When they left th table\nand went as usual to thank the old countess, Countess Mary heldout her\nhand and kissed her husband, and asked him why he was angry wih her.\n\n\"You always have such strange fancies! I didn't even think of eing\nangry,\" he replied.\n\nBut the word always seemed to her to imply: Yes, I am angry but I won't\ntell you why.\"\n\nNicholas and his wife live together so happily that even Sonya and the\nold countess, who felt jelous and would have liked them to disagree,\ncould find nothing to reprach them with; but even they had their\nmoments of antagonism. Occasionlly, and it was always just after they\nhad been happiest together, the suddenly had a feeling of estrangement\nand hostility, which occurred ost frequently during Countess Mary's\npregnancies, and this was such atime.\n\n\"Well, messieurs et mesdames,\" said Nicholas loudly and with aparent\ncheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpoe to\nvex her), \"I have been on my feet since six this morning. Tomorro I\nshall have to suffer, so today I'll go and rest.\"\n\nAnd without a wod to his wife he went to the little sitting room and\nlay down on the sfa.\n\n\"That's always the way,\" thought Countess Mary. \"He talks to everone\nexcept me. I see... I see that I am repulsive to him, especially wen I\nam in this condition.\" She looked down at her expanded figure andin the\nglass at her pale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes nowlooked\nlarger than ever.\n\nAnd everything annoyed her--Denisov's shoutig and laughter, Natasha's\ntalk, and especially a quick glance Sonya gae her.\n\nSonya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for feelng\nirritated.\n\nHaving sat awhile with her visitors without understandig anything of\nwhat they were saying, she softly left the room and wentto the nursery.\n\nThe children were playing at \"going to Moscow\" in a crriage made of\nchairs and invited her to go with them. She sat down an played with\nthem a little, but the thought of her husband and his unrasonable\ncrossness worried her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe withdifficulty, went to the small sitting room.\n\n\"Perhaps he is not asleep I'll have an explanation with him,\" she said\nto herself. Little Andre, her eldest boy, imitating his mother,\nfollowed her on tiptoe. She di not notice him.\n\n\"Mary, dear, I think he is asleep--he was so tired,\"said Sonya, meeting\nher in the large sitting room (it seemed to Countes Mary that she\ncrossed her path everywhere). \"Andrew may wake him.\"\n\nountess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, felt that\nonya was right, and for that very reason flushed and with evident\ndiffculty refrained from saying something harsh. She made no reply, but\ntoavoid obeying Sonya beckoned to Andrew to follow her quietly and went\no the door. Sonya went away by another door. From the room in which\nNiholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing, every\nslightet tone of which was familiar to his wife. As she listened to it\nshe sa before her his smooth handsome forehead, his mustache, and his\nwhole ace, as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night\nwhen heslept. Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat. And at\nthat momnt little Andrew shouted from outside the door: \"Papa! Mamma's\nstandin here!\" Countess Mary turned pale with fright and made signs to\nthe bo. He grew silent, and quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to\nCountess ary. She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through\nthe doorshe heard Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and\nhis voie said crossly:\n\n\"I can't get a moment's peace.... Mary, is that you? hy did you bring\nhim here?\"\n\n\"I only came in to look and did not notic... forgive me...\"\n\nNicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary mved away from the\ndoor and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minues later little\nblack-eyed three-year-old Natasha, her father's pet, hving learned from\nher brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in th sitting room, ran\nto her father unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyd little girl boldly\nopened the creaking door, went up to the sofa wit energetic steps of\nher sturdy little legs, and having examined the poition of her father,\nwho was asleep with his back to her, rose on tipte and kissed the hand\nwhich lay under his head. Nicholas turned with atender smile on his\nface.\n\n\"Natasha, Natasha!\" came Countess Mary's frghtened whisper from the\ndoor. \"Papa wants to sleep.\"\n\n\"No, Mamma, he oesn't want to sleep,\" said little Natasha with\nconviction. \"He's lauging.\"\n\nNicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took his daughter in his ams.\n\n\"Come in, Mary,\" he said to his wife.\n\nShe went in and sat down b her husband.\n\n\"I did not notice him following me,\" she said timidly. I just looked\nin.\"\n\nHolding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas glaced at his wife and,\nseeing her guilty expression, put his other arm aound her and kissed\nher hair.\n\n\"May I kiss Mamma?\" he asked Natasha.\n\natasha smiled bashfully.\n\n\"Again!\" she commanded, pointing with a pereptory gesture to the spot\nwhere Nicholas had placed the kiss.\n\n\"I don' know why you think I am cross,\" said Nicholas, replying to the\nquestin he knew was in his wife's mind.\n\n\"You have no idea how unhappy, how onely, I feel when you are like\nthat. It always seems to me...\"\n\n\"Mary don't talk nonsense. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\" he\nsaid galy.\n\n\"It seems to be that you can't love me, that I am so plain... alwys...\nand now... in this cond...\"\n\n\"Oh, how absurd you are! It is not eauty that endears, it's love that\nmakes us see beauty. It is only Malinas and women of that kind who are\nloved for their beauty. But do I lve my wife? I don't love her, but...\nI don't know how to put it. Withot you, or when something comes between\nus like this, I seem lost and cn't do anything. Now do I love my\nfinger? I don't love it, but just tr to cut it off!\"\n\n\"I'm not like that myself, but I understand. So you'e not angry with\nme?\"\n\n\"Awfully angry!\" he said, smiling and getting u. And smoothing his hair\nhe began to pace the room.\n\n\"Do you know, Mar, what I've been thinking?\" he began, immediately\nthinking aloud in hi wife's presence now that they had made it up.\n\nHe did not ask if she as ready to listen to him. He did not care. A\nthought had occurred to im and so it belonged to her also. And he told\nher of his intention topersuade Pierre to stay with them till spring.\n\nCountess Mary listenedtill he had finished, made some remark, and in\nher turn began thinkingaloud. Her thoughts were about the children.\n\n\"You can see the woman i her already,\" she said in French, pointing to\nlittle Natasha. \"You reroach us women with being illogical. Here is our\nlogic. I say: 'Papa wnts to sleep!' but she says, 'No, he's laughing.'\nAnd she was right,\" aid Countess Mary with a happy smile.\n\n\"Yes, yes.\" And Nicholas, takin his little daughter in his strong hand,\nlifted her high, placed her o his shoulder, held her by the legs, and\npaced the room with her. Ther was an expression of carefree happiness\non the faces of both father ad daughter.\n\n\"But you know you may be unfair. You are too fond of thisone,\" his wife\nwhispered in French.\n\n\"Yes, but what am I to do?... I ty not to show...\"\n\nAt that moment they heard the sound of the door puley and footsteps in\nthe hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived.\n\"Somebody has come.\"\n\n\"I am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see,\" sai Countess Mary and left\nthe room.\n\nIn her absence Nicholas allowed himelf to give his little daughter a\ngallop round the room. Out of breath he took the laughing child quickly\nfrom his shoulder and pressed her o his heart. His capers reminded him\nof dancing, and looking at the chld's round happy little face he\nthought of what she would be like whenhe was an old man, taking her\ninto society and dancing the mazurka wit her as his old father had\ndanced Daniel Cooper with his daughter.\n\n\"I is he, it is he, Nicholas!\" said Countess Mary, re-entering the room\n few minutes later. \"Now our Natasha has come to life. You should haveseen her ecstasy, and how he caught it for having stayed away so long.Well, come along now, quick, quick! It's time you two were parted,\" sh\nadded, looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father.\nNicholas went out holding the child by the hand.\n\nCountess Mary remaind in the sitting room.\n\n\"I should never, never have believed that one ould be so happy,\" she\nwhispered to herself. A smile lit up her face bt at the same time she\nsighed, and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadess as though she felt,\nthrough her happiness, that there is another srt of happiness\nunattainable in this life and of which she involuntariy thought at that\ninstant.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nNatasha had married in the erly spring of 1813, and in 1820 already had\nthree daughters besides a on for whom she had longed and whom she was\nnow nursing. She had grownstouter and broader, so that it was difficult\nto recognize in this robst, motherly woman the slim, lively Natasha of\nformer days. Her featurs were more defined and had a calm, soft, and\nserene expression. In he face there was none of the ever-glowing\nanimation that had formerly brned there and constituted its charm. Now\nher face and body were oftenall that one saw, and her soul was not\nvisible at all. All that struckthe eye was a strong, handsome, and\nfertile woman. The old fire very rrely kindled in her face now. That\nhappened only when, as was the casethat day, her husband returned home,\nor a sick child was convalescent,or when she and Countess Mary spoke of\nPrince Andrew (she never mentioed him to her husband, who she imagined\nwas jealous of Prince Andrew'smemory), or on the rare occasions when\nsomething happened to induce he to sing, a practice she had quite\nabandoned since her marriage. At th rare moments when the old fire did\nkindle in her handsome, fully deveoped body she was even more\nattractive than in former days.\n\nSince ther marriage Natasha and her husband had lived in Moscow, in\nPetersburg,on their estate near Moscow, or with her mother, that is to\nsay, in Niholas' house. The young Countess Bezukhova was not often seen\nin sociey, and those who met her there were not pleased with her and\nfound herneither attractive nor amiable. Not that Natasha liked\nsolitude--she dd not know whether she liked it or not, she even thought\nthat she did ot--but with her pregnancies, her confinements, the\nnursing of her chidren, and sharing every moment of her husband's life,\nshe had demands n her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing\nsociety. All wh had known Natasha before her marriage wondered at the\nchange in her a at something extraordinary. Only the old countess with\nher maternal istinct had realized that all Natasha's outbursts had been\ndue to her ned of children and a husband--as she herself had once\nexclaimed at Otrdnoe not so much in fun as in earnest--and her mother\nwas now surprise at the surprise expressed by those who had never\nunderstood Natasha, nd she kept saying that she had always known that\nNatasha would make a exemplary wife and mother.\n\n\"Only she lets her love of her husband an children overflow all\nbounds,\" said the countess, \"so that it even beomes absurd.\"\n\nNatasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by cleer folk,\nespecially by the French, which says that a girl should not lt herself\ngo when she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments,should be\neven more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarred, and\nshould fascinate her husband as much as she did before he becae her\nhusband. Natasha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her wtchery,\nof which her singing had been an unusually powerful part. She ave it up\njust because it was so powerfully seductive. She took no pais with her\nmanners or with delicacy of speech, or with her toilet, or o show\nherself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes, or to avid\ninconveniencing him by being too exacting. She acted in contradictin to\nall those rules. She felt that the allurements instinct had formely\ntaught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of herhusband, to whom she had from the first moment given herself up\nentirey--that is, with her whole soul, leaving no corner of it hidden\nfrom hm. She felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained by\nthe oetic feelings that had attracted him to her, but by something\nelse--idefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul.\n\nTo fluffout her curls, put on fashionable dresses, and sing romantic\nsongs to ascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn\nherself o attract herself. To adorn herself for others might perhaps\nhave beenagreeable--she did not know--but she had no time at all for\nit. The chef reason for devoting no time either to singing, to dress,\nor to chooing her words was that she really had no time to spare for\nthese thing.\n\nWe know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed ina\nsubject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject so\ntivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one's entire\natention is devoted to it.\n\nThe subject which wholly engrossed Natasha'sattention was her family:\nthat is, her husband whom she had to keep sothat he should belong\nentirely to her and to the home, and the childre whom she had to bear,\nbring into the world, nurse, and bring up.\n\nAndthe deeper she penetrated, not with her mind only but with her whole\nsul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed her, the larger\ndi that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers\napear, so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet\nws unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary.\n\nThere were hen as now conversations and discussions about women's\nrights, the reltions of husband and wife and their freedom and rights,\nthough these temes were not yet termed questions as they are now; but\nthese topics wre not merely uninteresting to Natasha, she positively\ndid not understnd them.\n\nThese questions, then as now, existed only for those who seenothing in\nmarriage but the pleasure married people get from one anothr, that is,\nonly the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significnce, which\nlies in the family.\n\nDiscussions and questions of that kind which are like the question of\nhow to get the greatest gratification rom one's dinner, did not then\nand do not now exist for those for whomthe purpose of a dinner is the\nnourishment it affords; and the purposeof marriage is the family.\n\nIf the purpose of dinner is to nourish thebody, a man who eats two\ndinners at once may perhaps get more enjoymen but will not attain his\npurpose, for his stomach will not digest the wo dinners.\n\nIf the purpose of marriage is the family, the person who ishes to have\nmany wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure,but in that\ncase will not have a family.\n\nIf the purpose of food is norishment and the purpose of marriage is the\nfamily, the whole questionresolves itself into not eating more than one\ncan digest, and not havig more wives or husbands than are needed for\nthe family--that is, one ife or one husband. Natasha needed a husband.\nA husband was given her nd he gave her a family. And she not only saw\nno need of any other or etter husband, but as all the powers of her\nsoul were intent on servin that husband and family, she could not\nimagine and saw no interest inimagining how it would be if things were\ndifferent.\n\nNatasha did not cre for society in general, but prized the more the\nsociety of her relaives--Countess Mary, and her brother, her mother,\nand Sonya. She value the company of those to whom she could come\nstriding disheveled from he nursery in her dressing gown, and with\njoyful face show a yellow intead of a green stain on baby's napkin, and\nfrom whom she could hear rassuring words to the effect that baby was\nmuch better.\n\nTo such an exent had Natasha let herself go that the way she dressed\nand did her har, her ill-chosen words, and her jealousy--she was\njealous of Sonya, o the governess, and of every woman, pretty or plain-\n-were habitual sujects of jest to those about her. The general opinion\nwas that Pierre as under his wife's thumb, which was really true. From\nthe very first ays of their married life Natasha had announced her\ndemands. Pierre wa greatly surprised by his wife's view, to him a\nperfectly novel one, tat every moment of his life belonged to her and\nto the family. His wif's demands astonished him, but they also\nflattered him, and he submittd to them.\n\nPierre's subjection consisted in the fact that he not onlydared not\nflirt with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any otherwoman; did\nnot dare dine at the club as a pastime, did not dare spend oney on a\nwhim, and did not dare absent himself for any length of time except on\nbusiness--in which his wife included his intellectual pursuts, which\nshe did not in the least understand but to which she attribued great\nimportance. To make up for this, at home Pierre had the rightto\nregulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose.At\nhome Natasha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husbad,\nand the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupied--that i,\nwas reading or writing in his study. Pierre had but to show a partiaity\nfor anything to get just what he liked done always. He had only toexpress a wish and Natasha would jump up and run to fulfill it.\n\nThe etire household was governed according to Pierre's supposed orders,\ntha is, by his wishes which Natasha tried to guess. Their way of life\nandplace of residence, their acquaintances and ties, Natasha's\noccupation, the children's upbringing, were all selected not merely\nwith regard o Pierre's expressed wishes, but to what Natasha from the\nthoughts he xpressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be. And she\ndeduced th essentials of his wishes quite correctly, and having once\narrived at hem clung to them tenaciously. When Pierre himself wanted to\nchange hi mind she would fight him with his own weapons.\n\nThus in a time of troble ever memorable to him after the birth of their\nfirst child who wasdelicate, when they had to change the wet nurse\nthree times and Natash fell ill from despair, Pierre one day told her\nof Rousseau's view, wih which he quite agreed, that to have a wet nurse\nis unnatural and harful. When her next baby was born, despite the\nopposition of her mother the doctors, and even of her husband himself--\nwho were all vigorousl opposed to her nursing her baby herself, a thing\nthen unheard of and onsidered injurious--she insisted on having her own\nway, and after thaa-la-de-bu-de-ba, e de-tra-va-\nga-la\" he sang.\n\n\"Fine! Just like the Fenchie! Oh, ho ho! Do you want some more to eat?\"\n\n\"Give him some porrdge: it takes a long time to get filled up after\nstarving.\"\n\nThey gavehim some more porridge and Morel with a laugh set to work on\nhis thirdbowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him.\nThe oldr men, who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such\nnonsene, continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire, but one\nwould ocasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at Morel with a\nsmile.\n\"They are men too,\" said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his\ncat. \"Even wormwood grows on its own root.\"\n\n\"O Lord, O Lord! How starr it is! Tremendous! That means a hard\nfrost....\"\n\nThey all grew silent The stars, as if knowing that no one was looking\nat them, began to diport themselves in the dark sky: now flaring up,\nnow vanishing, now trmbling, they were busy whispering something\ngladsome and mysterious toone another.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe French army melted away at the uniformrate of a mathematical\nprogression; and that crossing of the Berezina bout which so much has\nbeen written was only one intermediate stage inits destruction, and not\nat all the decisive episode of the campaign. f so much has been and\nstill is written about the Berezina, on the Frech side this is only\nbecause at the broken bridge across that river th calamities their army\nhad been previously enduring were suddenly concntrated at one moment\ninto a tragic spectacle that remained in every mmory, and on the\nRussian side merely because in Petersburg--far from te seat of war--a\nplan (again one of Pfuel's) had been devised to catchNapoleon in a\nstrategic trap at the Berezina River. Everyone assured hmself that all\nwould happen according to plan, and therefore insisted hat it was just\nthe crossing of the Berezina that destroyed the Frencharmy. In reality\nthe results of the crossing were much less disastrousto the French--in\nguns and men lost--than Krasnoe had been, as the figres show.\n\nThe sole importance of the crossing of the Berezina lies inthe fact\nthat it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all theplans for\ncutting off the enemy's retreat and the soundness of the onl possible\nline of action--the one Kutuzov and the general mass of the rmy\ndemanded--namely, simply to follow the enemy up. The French crowd led\nat a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed o\nreaching its goal. It fled like a wounded animal and it was impossibe\nto block its path. This was shown not so much by the arrangements itmade for crossing as by what took place at the bridges. When the bridgs\nbroke down, unarmed soldiers, people from Moscow and women with chilren\nwho were with the French transport, all--carried on by vis inertia--\npressed forward into boats and into the ice-covered water and did nt,\nsurrender.\n\nThat impulse was reasonable. The condition of fugitivesand of pursuers\nwas equally bad. As long as they remained with their on people each\nmight hope for help from his fellows and the definite plce he held\namong them. But those who surrendered, while remaining in te same\npitiful plight, would be on a lower level to claim a share in te\nnecessities of life. The French did not need to be informed of the fct\nthat half the prisoners--with whom the Russians did not know what t do-\n-perished of cold and hunger despite their captors' desire to sav them;\nthey felt that it could not be otherwise. The most compassionat Russian\ncommanders, those favorable to the French--and even the Frencmen in the\nRussian service--could do nothing for the prisoners. The Frnch perished\nfrom the conditions to which the Russian army was itself xposed. It was\nimpossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry an indispensable\nsoldiers to give to the French who, though not harmful,or hated, or\nguilty, were simply unnecessary. Some Russians even did tat, but they\nwere exceptions.\n\nCertain destruction lay behind the Frenh but in front there was hope.\nTheir ships had been burned, there was o salvation save in collective\nflight, and on that the whole strength f the French was concentrated.\n\nThe farther they fled the more wretche became the plight of the\nremnant, especially after the Berezina, on wich (in consequence of the\nPetersburg plan) special hopes had been plaed by the Russians, and the\nkeener grew the passions of the Russian comanders, who blamed one\nanother and Kutuzov most of all. Anticipation hat the failure of the\nPetersburg Berezina plan would be attributed toKutuzov led to\ndissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, more and more trongly\nexpressed. The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed n a\nrespectful form, making it impossible for him to ask wherein he wa to\nblame. They did not talk seriously to him; when reporting to him o\nasking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable\normality, but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at\nvery turn.\n\nBecause they could not understand him all these people assmed that it\nwas useless to talk to the old man; that he would never grsp the\nprofundity of their plans, that he would answer with his phrase (which\nthey thought were mere phrases) about a \"golden bridge,\" aboutthe\nimpossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalons,\nand so forth. They had heard all that before. And all he said--tht it\nwas necessary to await provisions, or that the men had no boots--as so\nsimple, while what they proposed was so complicated and clever, hat it\nwas evident that he was old and stupid and that they, though no in\npower, were commanders of genius.\n\nAfter the junction with the arm of the brilliant admiral and Petersburg\nhero Wittgenstein, this mood nd the gossip of the staff reached their\nmaximum. Kutuzov saw this andmerely sighed and shrugged his shoulders.\nOnly once, after the affair f the Berezina, did he get angry and write\nto Bennigsen (who reported eparately to the Emperor) the following\nletter:\n\n\"On account of your sells of ill health, will your excellency please be\nso good as to set of for Kaluga on receipt of this, and there await\nfurther commands and ppointments from His Imperial Majesty.\"\n\nBut after Bennigsen's departue, the Grand Duke Tsarevich Constantine\nPavlovich joined the army. He ad taken part in the beginning of the\ncampaign but had subsequently ben removed from the army by Kutuzov. Now\nhaving come to the army, he inormed Kutuzov of the Emperor's\ndispleasure at the poor success of our orces and the slowness of their\nadvance. The Emperor intended to join he army personally in a few days'\ntime.\n\nThe old man, experienced in curt as well as in military affairs--this\nsame Kutuzov who in August ha been chosen commander-in-chief against\nthe sovereign's wishes and whohad removed the Grand Duke and heir--\napparent from the army--who on hs own authority and contrary to the\nEmperor's will had decided on the bandonment of Moscow, now realized at\nonce that his day was over, thathis part was played, and that the power\nhe was supposed to hold was nolonger his. And he understood this not\nmerely from the attitude of thecourt. He saw on the one hand that the\nmilitary business in which he hd played his part was ended and felt\nthat his mission was accomplished and at the same time he began to be\nconscious of the physical wearines of his aged body and of the\nnecessity of physical rest.\n\nOn the tweny-ninth of November Kutuzov entered Vilna--his \"dear Vilna\"\nas he calld it. Twice during his career Kutuzov had been governor of\nVilna. In tat wealthy town, which had not been injured, he found old\nfriends and ssociations, besides the comforts of life of which he had\nso long beendeprived. And he suddenly turned from the cares of army and\nstate and,as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed,\nimmersed himsef in the quiet life to which he had formerly been\naccustomed, as if al that was taking place and all that had still to be\ndone in the realm f history did not concern him at all.\n\nChichagov, one of the most zealus \"cutters-off\" and \"breakers-up,\" who\nhad first wanted to effect a dversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but\nnever wished to go where he ws sent: Chichagov, noted for the boldness\nwith which he spoke to the Eperor, and who considered Kutuzov to be\nunder an obligation to him becuse when he was sent to make peace with\nTurkey in 1811 independently o Kutuzov, and found that peace had\nalready been concluded, he admittedto the Emperor that the merit of\nsecuring that peace was really Kutuzo's; this Chichagov was the first\nto meet Kutuzov at the castle where te latter was to stay. In undress\nnaval uniform, with a dirk, and holdig his cap under his arm, he handed\nKutuzov a garrison report and the kys of the town. The contemptuously\nrespectful attitude of the younger en to the old man in his dotage was\nexpressed in the highest degree bythe behavior of Chichagov, who knew\nof the accusations that were beingdirected against Kutuzov.\n\nWhen speaking to Chichagov, Kutuzov incidenally mentioned that the\nvehicles packed with china that had been captued from him at Borisov\nhad been recovered and would be restored to him\n\n\"You mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.... On the\ncontary, I can supply you with everything even if you want to give\ndinner arties,\" warmly replied Chichagov, who tried by every word he\nspoke toprove his own rectitude and therefore imagined Kutuzov to be\nanimated y the same desire.\n\nKutuzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with hissubtle penetrating\nsmile: \"I meant merely to say what I said.\"\n\nContray to the Emperor's wish Kutuzov detained the greater part of the\narmy t Vilna. Those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack\nandphysically feeble during his stay in that town. He attended to army\nafairs reluctantly, left everything to his generals, and while awaiting\nhe Emperor's arrival led a dissipated life.\n\nHaving left Petersburg onthe seventh of December with his suite--Count\nTolstoy, Prince Volkonsk, Arakcheev, and others--the Emperor reached\nVilna on the eleventh, an in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the\ncastle. In spite of thesevere frost some hundred generals and staff\nofficers in full parade uiform stood in front of the castle, as well as\na guard of honor of theSemenov regiment.\n\nA courier who galloped to the castle in advance, ina troyka with three\nfoam-flecked horses, shouted \"Coming!\" and Konovnisyn rushed into the\nvestibule to inform Kutuzov, who was waiting in th hall porter's little\nlodge.\n\nA minute later the old man's large stoutfigure in full-dress uniform,\nhis chest covered with orders and a scar drawn round his stomach,\nwaddled out into the porch. He put on his ha with its peaks to the\nsides and, holding his gloves in his hand and wlking with an effort\nsideways down the steps to the level of the stree, took in his hand the\nreport he had prepared for the Emperor.\n\nThere as running to and fro and whispering; another troyka flew\nfuriously up and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh in\nwhich the fgures of the Emperor and Volkonski could already be\ndescried.\n\nFrom th habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect\non th old general. He carefully and hastily felt himself all over,\nreadjustd his hat, and pulling himself together drew himself up and, at\nthe vey moment when the Emperor, having alighted from the sleigh,\nlifted hiseyes to him, handed him the report and began speaking in his\nsmooth, igratiating voice.\n\nThe Emperor with a rapid glance scanned Kutuzov fro head to foot,\nfrowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himsef went up to the\nold man, extended his arms and embraced him. And thisembrace too, owing\nto a long-standing impression related to his innermst feelings, had its\nusual effect on Kutuzov and he gave a sob.\n\nThe Eperor greeted the officers and the Semenov guard, and again\npressing te old man's hand went with him into the castle.\n\nWhen alone with the feld marshal the Emperor expressed his\ndissatisfaction at the slowness f the pursuit and at the mistakes made\nat Krasnoe and the Berezina, an informed him of his intentions for a\nfuture campaign abroad. Kutuzov ade no rejoinder or remark. The same\nsubmissive, expressionless look wth which he had listened to the\nEmperor's commands on the field of Auserlitz seven years before settled\non his face now.\n\nWhen Kutuzov came ut of the study and with lowered head was crossing\nthe ballroom with hs heavy waddling gait, he was arrested by someone's\nvoice saying:\n\n\"Yor Serene Highness!\"\n\nKutuzov raised his head and looked for a long whie into the eyes of\nCount Tolstoy, who stood before him holding a silve salver on which lay\na small object. Kutuzov seemed not to understand hat was expected of\nhim.\n\nSuddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely prceptible smile flashed\nacross his puffy face, and bowing low and respctfully he took the\nobject that lay on the salver. It was the Order ofSt. George of the\nFirst Class.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nNext day the field marsal gave a dinner and ball which the Emperor\nhonored by his presence. Ktuzov had received the Order of St. George of\nthe First Class and the mperor showed him the highest honors, but\neveryone knew of the imperia dissatisfaction with him. The proprieties\nwere observed and the Emperr was the first to set that example, but\neverybody understood that theold man was blameworthy and good-for-\nnothing. When Kutuzov, conformin to a custom of Catherine's day,\nordered the standards that had been cptured to be lowered at the\nEmperor's feet on his entering the ballroo, the Emperor made a wry face\nand muttered something in which some peole caught the words, \"the old\ncomedian.\"\n\nThe Emperor's displeasure wih Kutuzov was specially increased at Vilna\nby the fact that Kutuzov evdently could not or would not understand the\nimportance of the coming ampaign.\n\nWhen on the following morning the Emperor said to the offices assembled\nabout him: \"You have not only saved Russia, you have savedEurope!\" they\nall understood that the war was not ended.\n\nKutuzov alon would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that\nno fresh warcould improve the position or add to the glory of Russia,\nbut could ony spoil and lower the glorious position that Russia had\ngained. He trid to prove to the Emperor the impossibility of levying\nfresh troops, soke of the hardships already endured by the people, of\nthe possibilityof failure and so forth.\n\nThis being the field marshal's frame of mindhe was naturally regarded\nas merely a hindrance and obstacle to the imending war.\n\nTo avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man, the natual method was\nto do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and withBarclay at the\nbeginning of the Russian campaign--to transfer the authrity to the\nEmperor himself, thus cutting the ground from under the comander in\nchief's feet without upsetting the old man by informing him f the\nchange.\n\nWith this object his staff was gradually reconstructed nd its real\nstrength removed and transferred to the Emperor. Toll, Konvnitsyn, and\nErmolov received fresh appointments. Everyone spoke loudl of the field\nmarshal's great weakness and failing health.\n\nHis healthhad to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to\nanother. Andin fact his health was poor.\n\nSo naturally, simply, and gradually--jus as he had come from Turkey to\nthe Treasury in Petersburg to recruit te militia, and then to the army\nwhen he was needed there--now when hispart was played out, Kutuzov's\nplace was taken by a new and necessary erformer.\n\nThe war of 1812, besides its national significance dear to very Russian\nheart, was now to assume another, a European, significanc.\n\nThe movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a\novement of peoples from east to west, and for this fresh war another\nlader was necessary, having qualities and views differing from\nKutuzov' and animated by different motives.\n\nAlexander I was as necessary for he movement of the peoples from east\nto west and for the refixing of ntional frontiers as Kutuzov had been\nfor the salvation and glory of Rusia.\n\nKutuzov did not understand what Europe, the balance of power, orNapoleon meant. He could not understand it. For the representative of\nhe Russian people, after the enemy had been destroyed and Russia had\nben liberated and raised to the summit of her glory, there was nothing\neft to do as a Russian. Nothing remained for the representative of thenational war but to die, and Kutuzov died.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nAs generaly happens, Pierre did not feel the full effects of the\nphysical privaton and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after\nthey were over. fter his liberation he reached Orel, and on the third\nday there, when reparing to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was laid up for\nthree months. e had what the doctors termed \"bilious fever.\" But\ndespite the fact tht the doctors treated him, bled him, and gave him\nmedicines to drink, e recovered.\n\nScarcely any impression was left on Pierre's mind by allthat happened\nto him from the time of his rescue till his illness. He emembered only\nthe dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy, internalphysical\ndistress, and pains in his feet and side. He remembered a genral\nimpression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of bein\nworried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him,he\nalso remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses and\nabove all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all thattime.\nOn the day of his rescue he had seen the body of Petya Rostov. Tat same\nday he had learned that Prince Andrew, after surviving the batle of\nBorodino for more than a month had recently died in the Rostovs'house\nat Yaroslavl, and Denisov who told him this news also mentioned elene's\ndeath, supposing that Pierre had heard of it long before. All his at\nthe time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not rasp its\nsignificance. Just then he was only anxious to get away as quckly as\npossible from places where people were killing one another, tosome\npeaceful refuge where he could recover himself, rest, and think oer all\nthe strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching Orel he\nimediately fell ill. When he came to himself after his illness he saw\ni attendance on him two of his servants, Terenty and Vaska, who had\ncom from Moscow; and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had been\nliing on his estate at Elets and hearing of his rescue and illness had\ncme to look after him.\n\nIt was only gradually during his convalescence hat Pierre lost the\nimpressions he had become accustomed to during thelast few months and\ngot used to the idea that no one would oblige him o go anywhere\ntomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed,and that he\nwould be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper. But for  long time in\nhis dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of capivity. In the\nsame way little by little he came to understand the newshe had been\ntold after his rescue, about the death of Prince Andrew, te death of\nhis wife, and the destruction of the French.\n\nA joyous feelng of freedom--that complete inalienable freedom natural\nto man which e had first experienced at the first halt outside Moscow--\nfilled Piere's soul during his convalescence. He was surprised to find\nthat this nner freedom, which was independent of external conditions,\nnow had asit were an additional setting of external liberty. He was\nalone in a srange town, without acquaintances. No one demanded anything\nof him or ent him anywhere. He had all he wanted: the thought of his\nwife which ad been a continual torment to him was no longer there,\nsince she was o more.\n\n\"Oh, how good! How splendid!\" said he to himself when a cleany laid\ntable was moved up to him with savory beef tea, or when he lay own for\nthe night on a soft clean bed, or when he remembered that the rench had\ngone and that his wife was no more. \"Oh, how good, how splenid!\"\n\nAnd by old habit he asked himself the question: \"Well, and what hen?\nWhat am I going to do?\" And he immediately gave himself the answe:\n\"Well, I shall live. Ah, how splendid!\"\n\nThe very question that had ormerly tormented him, the thing he had\ncontinually sought to find--th aim of life--no longer existed for him\nnow. That search for the aim o life had not merely disappeared\ntemporarily--he felt that it no longe existed for him and could not\npresent itself again. And this very absnce of an aim gave him the\ncomplete, joyous sense of freedom which contituted his happiness at\nthis time.\n\nHe could not see an aim, for he nw had faith--not faith in any kind of\nrule, or words, or ideas, but fath in an ever-living, ever-manifest\nGod. Formerly he had sought Him inaims he set himself. That search for\nan aim had been simply a search fr God, and suddenly in his captivity\nhe had learned not by words or resoning but by direct feeling what his\nnurse had told him long ago: tha God is here and everywhere. In his\ncaptivity he had learned that in Krataev God was greater, more infinite\nand unfathomable than in the Arcitect of the Universe recognized by the\nFreemasons. He felt like a manwho after straining his eyes to see into\nthe far distance finds what h sought at his very feet. All his life he\nhad looked over the heads ofthe men around him, when he should have\nmerely looked in front of him ithout straining his eyes.\n\nIn the past he had never been able to findthat great inscrutable\ninfinite something. He had only felt that it mut exist somewhere and\nhad looked for it. In everything near and compreensible he had only\nwhat was limited, petty, commonplace, and senseles. He had equipped\nhimself with a mental telescope and looked into remoe space, where\npetty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had semed to him\ngreat and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen.And such had\nEuropean life, politics, Freemasonry, philosophy, and phianthropy\nseemed to him. But even then, at moments of weakness as he ha accounted\nthem, his mind had penetrated to those distances and he hadthere seen\nthe same pettiness, worldliness, and senselessness. Now, hoever, he had\nlearned to see the great, eternal, and infinite in everyting, and\ntherefore--to see it and enjoy its contemplation--he naturall threw\naway the telescope through which he had till now gazed over mens heads,\nand gladly regarded the ever-changing, eternally great, unfatomable,\nand infinite life around him. And the closer he looked the mor tranquil\nand happy he became. That dreadful question, \"What for?\" whih had\nformerly destroyed all his mental edifices, no longer existed fo him.\nTo that question, \"What for?\" a simple answer was now always reay in\nhis soul: \"Because there is a God, that God without whose will no one\nhair falls from a man's head.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIn external waysPierre had hardly changed at all. In appearance he was\njust what he usd to be. As before he was absent-minded and seemed\noccupied not with wat was before his eyes but with something special of\nhis own. The diffrence between his former and present self was that\nformerly when he di not grasp what lay before him or was said to him,\nhe had puckered hisforehead painfully as if vainly seeking to\ndistinguish something at a istance. At present he still forgot what was\nsaid to him and still didnot see what was before his eyes, but he now\nlooked with a scarcely peceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what\nwas before him and listene to what was said, though evidently seeing\nand hearing something quitedifferent. Formerly he had appeared to be a\nkindhearted but unhappy ma, and so people had been inclined to avoid\nhim. Now a smile at the joyof life always played round his lips, and\nsympathy for others, shone i his eyes with a questioning look as to\nwhether they were as contentedas he was, and people felt pleased by his\npresence.\n\nPreviously he hadtalked a great deal, grew excited when he talked, and\nseldom listened;now he was seldom carried away in conversation and knew\nhow to listen o that people readily told him their most intimate\nsecrets.\n\nThe princss, who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly\nhostile to hi since she had felt herself under obligations to him after\nthe old cout's death, now after staying a short time in Orel--where she\nhad come ntending to show Pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she\nconsidere it her duty to nurse him--felt to her surprise and vexation\nthat she ad become fond of him. Pierre did not in any way seek her\napproval, hemerely studied her with interest. Formerly she had felt\nthat he regardd her with indifference and irony, and so had shrunk into\nherself as se did with others and had shown him only the combative side\nof her natre; but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most\nintimate plaes of her heart, and, mistrustfully at first but afterwards\ngratefully she let him see the hidden, kindly sides of her character.\n\nThe most unning man could not have crept into her confidence more\nsuccessfully,evoking memories of the best times of her youth and\nshowing sympathy wth them. Yet Pierre's cunning consisted simply in\nfinding pleasure in rawing out the human qualities of the embittered,\nhard, and (in her ow way) proud princess.\n\n\"Yes, he is a very, very kind man when he is no under the influence of\nbad people but of people such as myself,\" thouht she.\n\nHis servants too--Terenty and Vaska--in their own way noticedthe change\nthat had taken place in Pierre. They considered that he hadbecome much\n\"simpler.\" Terenty, when he had helped him undress and wised him good\nnight, often lingered with his master's boots in his handsand clothes\nover his arm, to see whether he would not start a talk. An Pierre,\nnoticing that Terenty wanted a chat, generally kept him there\n\n\"Well, tell me... now, how did you get food?\" he would ask.\n\nAnd Ternty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow, and of the\nold cunt, and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and\ntalking, r sometimes listening to Pierre's stories, and then would go\nout into he hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and\naffectio for him.\n\nThe doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, tough he\nconsidered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose ever moment\nwas of value to suffering humanity, would sit for hours with Perre\ntelling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the\nchracters of his patients in general, and especially of the ladies.\n\n\"Its a pleasure to talk to a man like that; he is not like our\nprovincial,\" he would say.\n\nThere were several prisoners from the French army inOrel, and the\ndoctor brought one of them, a young Italian, to see Piere.\n\nThis officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used to make un of\nthe tenderness the Italian expressed for him.\n\nThe Italian seeme happy only when he could come to see Pierre, talk\nwith him, tell him bout his past, his life at home, and his love, and\npour out to him hisindignation against the French and especially\nagainst Napoleon.\n\n\"If al Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight\nsuch a ation,\" he said to Pierre. \"You, who have suffered so from the\nFrench,do not even feel animosity toward them.\"\n\nPierre had evoked the passioate affection of the Italian merely by\nevoking the best side of his naure and taking a pleasure in so doing.\n\nDuring the last days of Pierres stay in Orel his old masonic\nacquaintance Count Willarski, who had itroduced him to the lodge in\n1807, came to see him. Willarski was marred to a Russian heiress who\nhad a large estate in Orel province, and h occupied a temporary post in\nthe commissariat department in that town\n\nHearing that Bezukhov was in Orel, Willarski, though they had never een\nintimate, came to him with the professions of friendship and intimcy\nthat people who meet in a desert generally express for one another.Willarski felt dull in Orel and was pleased to meet a man of his own\ncrcle and, as he supposed, of similar interests.\n\nBut to his surprise Wllarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged much\nbehind the times, andhad sunk, as he expressed it to himself, into\napathy and egotism.\n\n\"Yo are letting yourself go, my dear fellow,\" he said.\n\nBut for all that illarski found it pleasanter now than it had been\nformerly to be with ierre, and came to see him every day. To Pierre as\nhe looked at and litened to Willarski, it seemed strange to think that\nhe had been like tat himself but a short time before.\n\nWillarski was a married man with  family, busy with his family affairs,\nhis wife's affairs, and his offcial duties. He regarded all these\noccupations as hindrances to life, nd considered that they were all\ncontemptible because their aim was th welfare of himself and his\nfamily. Military, administrative, politica, and masonic interests\ncontinually absorbed his attention. And Pierre without trying to change\nthe other's views and without condemning him but with the quiet,\njoyful, and amused smile now habitual to him, wasinterested in this\nstrange though very familiar phenomenon.\n\nThere wasa new feature in Pierre's relations with Willarski, with the\nprincess,with the doctor, and with all the people he now met, which\ngained for im the general good will. This was his acknowledgment of the\nimpossibiity of changing a man's convictions by words, and his\nrecognition of te possibility of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing\nthings each frm his own point of view. This legitimate peculiarity of\neach individua which used to excite and irritate Pierre now became a\nbasis of the sypathy he felt for, and the interest he took in, other\npeople. The diffrence, and sometimes complete contradiction, between\nmen's opinions an their lives, and between one man and another, pleased\nhim and drew frm him an amused and gentle smile.\n\nIn practical matters Pierre unexpecedly felt within himself a center of\ngravity he had previously lacked.Formerly all pecuniary questions,\nespecially requests for money to whih, as an extremely wealthy man, he\nwas very exposed, produced in him astate of hopeless agitation and\nperplexity. \"To give or not to give?\" e had asked himself. \"I have it\nand he needs it. But someone else need it still more. Who needs it\nmost? And perhaps they are both impostors\" In the old days he had been\nunable to find a way out of all these sumises and had given to all who\nasked as long as he had anything to giv. Formerly he had been in a\nsimilar state of perplexity with regard toevery question concerning his\nproperty, when one person advised one thng and another something else.\n\nNow to his surprise he found that he n longer felt either doubt or\nperplexity about these questions. There ws now within him a judge who\nby some rule unknown to him decided what hould or should not be done.\n\nHe was as indifferent as heretofore to mney matters, but now he felt\ncertain of what ought and what ought not o be done. The first time he\nhad recourse to his new judge was when a rench prisoner, a colonel,\ncame to him and, after talking a great dealabout his exploits,\nconcluded by making what amounted to a demand thatPierre should give\nhim four thousand francs to send to his wife and chldren. Pierre\nrefused without the least difficulty or effort, and was fterwards\nsurprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear s\ninsurmountably difficult. At the same time that he refused the colone's\ndemand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice wen\nleaving Orel, to induce the Italian officer to accept some money ofwhich he was evidently in need. A further proof to Pierre of his own\nmre settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision\nith regard to his wife's debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in\nnd near Moscow.\n\nHis head steward came to him at Orel and Pierre reckoed up with him his\ndiminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost hm, according to the\nhead steward's calculation, about two million rubls.\n\nTo console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an esimate\nshowing that despite these losses his income would not be diminihed but\nwould even be increased if he refused to pay his wife's debts hich he\nwas under no obligation to meet, and did not rebuild his Mosco house\nand the country house on his Moscow estate, which had cost him ighty\nthousand rubles a year and brought in nothing.\n\n\"Yes, of course hat's true,\" said Pierre with a cheerful smile. \"I\ndon't need all thatat all. By being ruined I have become much richer.\"\n\nBut in January Saelich came from Moscow and gave him an account of the\nstate of things here, and spoke of the estimate an architect had made\nof the cost of rbuilding the town and country houses, speaking of this\nas of a settledmatter. About the same time he received letters from\nPrince Vasili andother Petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wife's\ndebts. And Pierr decided that the steward's proposals which had so\npleased him were wrng and that he must go to Petersburg and settle his\nwife's affairs andmust rebuild in Moscow. Why this was necessary he did\nnot know, but heknew for certain that it was necessary. His income\nwould be reduced bythree fourths, but he felt it must be done.\n\nWillarski was going to Mocow and they agreed to travel together.\n\nDuring the whole time of his onvalescence in Orel Pierre had\nexperienced a feeling of joy, freedom,and life; but when during his\njourney he found himself in the open word and saw hundreds of new\nfaces, that feeling was intensified. Throughut his journey he felt like\na schoolboy on holiday. Everyone--the stagcoach driver, the post-house\noverseers, the peasants on the roads and n the villages--had a new\nsignificance for him. The presence and remars of Willarski who\ncontinually deplored the ignorance and poverty of Rssia and its\nbackwardness compared with Europe only heightened Pierre' pleasure.\nWhere Willarski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary stength and\nvitality--the strength which in that vast space amid the snos\nmaintained the life of this original, peculiar, and unique people. H\ndid not contradict Willarski and even seemed to agree with him--an\naparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that\ncouldlead to nothing--and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHATER XIV\n\nIt would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose hap has\nbeen destroyed are hurrying: some from the heap dragging bits o\nrubbish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the heap, or why they\njotle, overtake one another, and fight, and it would be equally\ndifficul to explain what caused the Russians after the departure of the\nFrenchto throng to the place that had formerly been Moscow. But when we\nwatc the ants round their ruined heap, the tenacity, energy, and\nimmense nmber of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction\nof the eap, something indestructible, which though intangible is the\nreal strngth of the colony, still exists; and similarly, though in\nMoscow in te month of October there was no government and no churches,\nshrines, rches, or houses--it was still the Moscow it had been in\nAugust. All wa destroyed, except something intangible yet powerful and\nindestructibl.\n\nThe motives of those who thronged from all sides to Moscow after ithad\nbeen cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, and at frst\nfor the most part savage and brutal. One motive only they all had n\ncommon: a desire to get to the place that had been called Moscow, toapply their activities there.\n\nWithin a week Moscow already had fiftee thousand inhabitants, in a\nfortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on.By the autumn of 1813 the\nnumber, ever increasing and increasing, exceded what it had been in\n1812.\n\nThe first Russians to enter Moscow werethe Cossacks of Wintzingerode's\ndetachment, peasants from the adjacentvillages, and residents who had\nfled from Moscow and had been hiding i its vicinity. The Russians who\nentered Moscow, finding it plundered, lundered it in their turn. They\ncontinued what the French had begun. Tains of peasant carts came to\nMoscow to carry off to the villages whathad been abandoned in the\nruined houses and the streets. The Cossacks arried off what they could\nto their camps, and the householders seizedall they could find in other\nhouses and moved it to their own, pretendng that it was their property.\n\nBut the first plunderers were followedby a second and a third\ncontingent, and with increasing numbers plundeing became more and more\ndifficult and assumed more definite forms.\n\nTe French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of\nreguar life, with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship, with\nluxry, and governmental and religious institutions. These forms were\nlifeess but still existed. There were bazaars, shops, warehouses,\nmarket salls, granaries--for the most part still stocked with goods--\nand ther were factories and workshops, palaces and wealthy houses\nfilled with uxuries, hospitals, prisons, government offices, churches,\nand cathedrls. The longer the French remained the more these forms of\ntown life prished, until finally all was merged into one confused,\nlifeless sceneof plunder.\n\nThe more the plundering by the French continued, the moreboth the\nwealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destryed. But\nplundering by the Russians, with which the reoccupation of th city\nbegan, had an opposite effect: the longer it continued and the geater\nthe number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the ealth\nof the city and its regular life restored.\n\nBesides the plunderes, very various people, some drawn by curiosity,\nsome by official dutis, some by self-interest--house owners, clergy,\nofficials of all kinds tradesmen, artisans, and peasants--streamed into\nMoscow as blood flow to the heart.\n\nWithin a week the peasants who came with empty carts t carry off\nplunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart th corpses out\nof the town. Other peasants, having heard of their comrads'\ndiscomfiture, came to town bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat don\none another's prices to below what they had been in former days. Gans\nof carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in Moscow every day, and o\nall sides logs were being hewn, new houses built, and old, charred ons\nrepaired. Tradesmen began trading in booths. Cookshops and taverns wre\nopened in partially burned houses. The clergy resumed the services n\nmany churches that had not been burned. Donors contributed Church\nprperty that had been stolen. Government clerks set up their baize-\ncoveed tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms. The\nhighe authorities and the police organized the distribution of goods\nleft bhind by the French. The owners of houses in which much property\nhad ben left, brought there from other houses, complained of the\ninjustice o taking everything to the Faceted Palace in the Kremlin;\nothers insistd that as the French had gathered things from different\nhouses into ths or that house, it would be unfair to allow its owner to\nkeep all tha was found there. They abused the police and bribed them,\nmade out estmates at ten times their value for government stores that\nhad perishedin the fire, and demanded relief. And Count Rostopchin\nwrote proclamatons.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nAt the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and sayed in an annex of\nhis house which had not been burned. He called on ount Rostopchin and\non some acquaintances who were back in Moscow, andhe intended to leave\nfor Petersburg two days later. Everybody was celerating the victory,\neverything was bubbling with life in the ruined bu reviving city.\nEveryone was pleased to see Pierre, everyone wished tomeet him, and\neveryone questioned him about what he had seen. Pierre flt particularly\nwell disposed toward them all, but was now instinctivey on his guard\nfor fear of binding himself in any way. To all question put to him--\nwhether important or quite trifling--such as: Where woul he live? Was\nhe going to rebuild? When was he going to Petersburg andwould he mind\ntaking a parcel for someone?--he replied: \"Yes, perhaps, or, \"I think\nso,\" and so on.\n\nHe had heard that the Rostovs were at Kstroma but the thought of\nNatasha seldom occurred to him. If it did itwas only as a pleasant\nmemory of the distant past. He felt himself notonly free from social\nobligations but also from that feeling which, itseemed to him, he had\naroused in himself.\n\nOn the third day after his rrival he heard from the Drubetskoys that\nPrincess Mary was in Moscow.The death, sufferings, and last days of\nPrince Andrew had often occupid Pierre's thoughts and now recurred to\nhim with fresh vividness. Havig heard at dinner that Princess Mary was\nin Moscow and living in her huse--which had not been burned--in\nVozdvizhenka Street, he drove that ame evening to see her.\n\nOn his way to the house Pierre kept thinking f Prince Andrew, of their\nfriendship, of his various meetings with him and especially of the last\none at Borodino.\n\n\"Is it possible that he ied in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?\nIs it possible that th meaning of life was not disclosed to him before\nhe died?\" thought Piere. He recalled Karataev and his death and\ninvoluntarily began to compre these two men, so different, and yet so\nsimilar in that they had boh lived and both died and in the love he\nfelt for both of them.\n\nPierr drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood.\nThe huse had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but its\ngeneral asect was unchanged. The old footman, who met Pierre with a\nstern face a if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence of\nthe old princ had not disturbed the order of things in the house,\ninformed him thatthe princess had gone to her own apartments, and that\nshe received on undays.\n\n\"Announce me. Perhaps she will see me,\" said Pierre.\n\n\"Yes, sr,\" said the man. \"Please step into the portrait gallery.\"\n\nA few minues later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought\nword from th princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he\nwould excuseher want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment.\n\nIn a rather ow room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her\nanother persondressed in black. Pierre remembered that the princess\nalways had lady ompanions, but who they were and what they were like he\nnever knew or emembered. \"This must be one of her companions,\" he\nthought, glancing t the lady in the black dress.\n\nThe princess rose quickly to meet him nd held out her hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, looking at his altered face afer he had kissed her\nhand, \"so this is how we meet again. He spoke of ou even at the very\nlast,\" she went on, turning her eyes from Pierre t her companion with a\nshyness that surprised him for an instant.\n\n\"I ws so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of good\nnews e had received for a long time.\"\n\nAgain the princess glanced round at er companion with even more\nuneasiness in her manner and was about to dd something, but Pierre\ninterrupted her.\n\n\"Just imagine--I knew nothig about him!\" said he. \"I thought he had\nbeen killed. All I know I head at second hand from others. I only know\nthat he fell in with the Rosovs.... What a strange coincidence!\"\n\nPierre spoke rapidly and with anmation. He glanced once at the\ncompanion's face, saw her attentive andkindly gaze fixed on him, and,\nas often happens when one is talking, flt somehow that this companion\nin the black dress was a good, kind, exellent creature who would not\nhinder his conversing freely with Princes Mary.\n\nBut when he mentioned the Rostovs, Princess Mary's face expresed still\ngreater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierres face to\nthat of the lady in the black dress and said:\n\n\"Do you reall not recognize her?\"\n\nPierre looked again at the companion's pale, delcate face with its\nblack eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near t him, long forgotten\nand more than sweet, looked at him from those attntive eyes.\n\n\"But no, it can't be!\" he thought. \"This stern, thin, pal face that\nlooks so much older! It cannot be she. It merely reminds meof her.\" But\nat that moment Princess Mary said, \"Natasha!\" And with dificulty,\neffort, and stress, like the opening of a door grown rusty onits\nhinges, a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and rom\nthat opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierrewith\na happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even ben\nthinking--especially at that moment. It suffused him, seized him, an\nenveloped him completely. When she smiled doubt was no longer possibl,\nit was Natasha and he loved her.\n\nAt that moment Pierre involuntaril betrayed to her, to Princess Mary,\nand above all to himself, a secretof which he himself had been unaware.\nHe flushed joyfully yet with paiful distress. He tried to hide his\nagitation. But the more he tried tohide it the more clearly--clearer\nthan any words could have done--did e betray to himself, to her, and to\nPrincess Mary that he loved her.\n\nNo, it's only the unexpectedness of it,\" thought Pierre. But as soon a\nhe tried to continue the conversation he had begun with Princess Maryhe\nagain glanced at Natasha, and a still-deeper flush suffused his fac and\na still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his sou. He\nbecame confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what h was\nsaying.\n\nPierre had failed to notice Natasha because he did not a all expect to\nsee her there, but he had failed to recognize her becaue the change in\nher since he last saw her was immense. She had grown tin and pale, but\nthat was not what made her unrecognizable; she was unecognizable at the\nmoment he entered because on that face whose eyes hd always shone with\na suppressed smile of the joy of life, now when hefirst entered and\nglanced at her there was not the least shadow of a sile: only her eyes\nwere kindly attentive and sadly interrogative.\n\nPiere's confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Natasha's part,\nbt only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\"She has come to stay with me,\" said Princess Mary. \"Thecount and\ncountess will be here in a few days. The countess is in a dradful\nstate; but it was necessary for Natasha herself to see a doctor.They\ninsisted on her coming with me.\"\n\n\"Yes, is there a family free frm sorrow now?\" said Pierre, addressing\nNatasha. \"You know it happened he very day we were rescued. I saw him.\nWhat a delightful boy he was!\"\nNatasha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her eyes\nwidned and lit up.\n\n\"What can one say or think of as a consolation?\" saidPierre. \"Nothing!\nWhy had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die\"\n\n\"Yes, in these days it would be hard to live without faith...\" remaked\nPrincess Mary.\n\n\"Yes, yes, that is really true,\" Pierre hastily inerrupted her.\n\n\"Why is it true?\" Natasha asked, looking attentively ino Pierre's eyes.\n\n\"How can you ask why?\" said Princess Mary. \"The thouht alone of what\nawaits...\"\n\nNatasha without waiting for Princess Maryto finish again looked\ninquiringly at Pierre.\n\n\"And because,\" Pierre cntinued, \"only one who believes that there is a\nGod ruling us can beara loss such as hers and... yours.\"\n\nNatasha had already opened her mouh to speak but suddenly stopped.\nPierre hurriedly turned away from herand again addressed Princess Mary,\nasking about his friend's last days\n\nPierre's confusion had now almost vanished, but at the same time he elt\nthat his freedom had also completely gone. He felt that there was ow a\njudge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more t him\nthan that of all the rest of the world. As he spoke now he was\ncosidering what impression his words would make on Natasha. He did not\nprposely say things to please her, but whatever he was saying he\nregardd from her standpoint.\n\nPrincess Mary--reluctantly as is usual in suchcases--began telling of\nthe condition in which she had found Prince Anrew. But Pierre's face\nquivering with emotion, his questions and his eger restless expression,\ngradually compelled her to go into details whch she feared to recall\nfor her own sake.\n\n\"Yes, yes, and so...?\" Piere kept saying as he leaned toward her with\nhis whole body and eagerly istened to her story. \"Yes, yes... so he\ngrew tranquil and softened? Wth all his soul he had always sought one\nthing--to be perfectly good--o he could not be afraid of death. The\nfaults he had--if he had any--wre not of his making. So he did\nsoften?... What a happy thing that he aw you again,\" he added, suddenly\nturning to Natasha and looking at he with eyes full of tears.\n\nNatasha's face twitched. She frowned and loered her eyes for a moment.\nShe hesitated for an instant whether to spak or not.\n\n\"Yes, that was happiness,\" she then said in her quiet voic with its\ndeep chest notes. \"For me it certainly was happiness.\" She pused. \"And\nhe... he... he said he was wishing for it at the very momen I entered\nthe room....\"\n\nNatasha's voice broke. She blushed, pressed er clasped hands on her\nknees, and then controlling herself with an evdent effort lifted her\nhead and began to speak rapidly.\n\n\"We knew nothng of it when we started from Moscow. I did not dare to\nask about him.Then suddenly Sonya told me he was traveling with us. I\nhad no idea an could not imagine what state he was in, all I wanted was\nto see him ad be with him,\" she said, trembling, and breathing quickly.\n\nAnd not ltting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had\nnever yet metioned to anyone--all she had lived through during those\nthree weeks o their journey and life at Yaroslavl.\n\nPierre listened to her with lip parted and eyes fixed upon her full of\ntears. As he listened he did nt think of Prince Andrew, nor of death,\nnor of what she was telling. H listened to her and felt only pity for\nher, for what she was sufferin now while she was speaking.\n\nPrincess Mary, frowning in her effort tohold back her tears, sat beside\nNatasha, and heard for the first time he story of those last days of\nher brother's and Natasha's love.\n\nEvidntly Natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.\n\nShe spoke, ingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of\nher soul, ad it seemed as if she could never finish. Several times she\nrepeated te same thing twice.\n\nDessalles' voice was heard outside the door askin whether little\nNicholas might come in to say good night.\n\n\"Well, thats all--everything,\" said Natasha.\n\nShe got up quickly just as Nicholasentered, almost ran to the door\nwhich was hidden by curtains, struck hr head against it, and rushed\nfrom the room with a moan either of painor sorrow.\n\nPierre gazed at the door through which she had disappearedand did not\nunderstand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world.\n\nPincess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention\nt her nephew who had entered the room.\n\nAt that moment of emotional tenerness young Nicholas' face, which\nresembled his father's, affected Pirre so much that when he had kissed\nthe boy he got up quickly, took ou his handkerchief, and went to the\nwindow. He wished to take leave of rincess Mary, but she would not let\nhim go.\n\n\"No, Natasha and I someties don't go to sleep till after two, so please\ndon't go. I will order upper. Go downstairs, we will come immediately.\"\n\nBefore Pierre left te room Princess Mary told him: \"This is the first\ntime she has talked f him like that.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nPierre was shown into the large, bightly lit dining room; a few minutes\nlater he heard footsteps and Pricess Mary entered with Natasha. Natasha\nwas calm, though a severe and rave expression had again settled on her\nface. They all three of them ow experienced that feeling of awkwardness\nwhich usually follows aftera serious and heartfelt talk. It is\nimpossible to go back to the same onversation, to talk of trifles is\nawkward, and yet the desire to spea is there and silence seems like\naffectation. They went silently to tale. The footmen drew back the\nchairs and pushed them up again. Pierre nfolded his cold table napkin\nand, resolving to break the silence, looed at Natasha and at Princess\nMary. They had evidently both formed thesame resolution; the eyes of\nboth shone with satisfaction and a confesion that besides sorrow life\nalso has joy.\n\n\"Do you take vodka, Count? asked Princess Mary, and those words\nsuddenly banished the shadows ofthe past. \"Now tell us about yourself,\"\nsaid she. \"One hears such imprbable wonders about you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Pierre with the smile of mil irony now habitual to him.\n\"They even tell me wonders I myself never reamed of! Mary Abramovna\ninvited me to her house and kept telling me hat had happened, or ought\nto have happened, to me. Stepan Stepanych aso instructed me how I ought\nto tell of my experiences. In general I hve noticed that it is very\neasy to be an interesting man (I am an inteesting man now); people\ninvite me out and tell me all about myself.\"\n\natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking.\n\n\"We have been told,\" rincess Mary interrupted her, \"that you lost two\nmillions in Moscow. I that true?\"\n\n\"But I am three times as rich as before,\" returned Pierr.\n\nThough the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wifes\ndebts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained that he hadbecome three times as rich as before.\n\n\"What I have certainly gained i freedom,\" he began seriously, but did\nnot continue, noticing that thi theme was too egotistic.\n\n\"And are you building?\"\n\n\"Yes. Savelich say I must!\"\n\n\"Tell me, you did not know of the countess' death when you ecided to\nremain in Moscow?\" asked Princess Mary and immediately blushd, noticing\nthat her question, following his mention of freedom, ascried to his\nwords a meaning he had perhaps not intended.\n\n\"No,\" answeredPierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning\nPrincess Mary ha given to his words. \"I heard of it in Orel and you\ncannot imagine howit shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple,\" he\nadded quickly, glacing at Natasha and noticing on her face curiosity as\nto how he would peak of his wife, \"but her death shocked me terribly.\nWhen two people uarrel they are always both in fault, and one's own\nguilt suddenly becmes terribly serious when the other is no longer\nalive. And then such  death... without friends and without consolation!\nI am very, very sory for her,\" he concluded, and was pleased to notice\na look of glad appoval on Natasha's face.\n\n\"Yes, and so you are once more an eligible bahelor,\" said Princess\nMary.\n\nPierre suddenly flushed crimson and for along time tried not to look at\nNatasha. When he ventured to glance herway again her face was cold,\nstern, and he fancied even contemptuous.\n\"And did you really see and speak to Napoleon, as we have been told?\"\naid Princess Mary.\n\nPierre laughed.\n\n\"No, not once! Everybody seems toimagine that being taken prisoner\nmeans being Napoleon's guest. Not ony did I never see him but I heard\nnothing about him--I was in much lowr company!\"\n\nSupper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to spea about his\ncaptivity was gradually led on to do so.\n\n\"But it's true tht you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?\" Natasha\nasked with a sligh smile. \"I guessed it then when we met at the\nSukharev tower, do you rmember?\"\n\nPierre admitted that it was true, and from that was graduall led by\nPrincess Mary's questions and especially by Natasha's into givng a\ndetailed account of his adventures.\n\nAt first he spoke with the aused and mild irony now customary with him\ntoward everybody and especilly toward himself, but when he came to\ndescribe the horrors and suffeings he had witnessed he was\nunconsciously carried away and began speaing with the suppressed\nemotion of a man re-experiencing in recollectin strong impressions he\nhas lived through.\n\nPrincess Mary with a gentl smile looked now at Pierre and now at\nNatasha. In the whole narrativeshe saw only Pierre and his goodness.\nNatasha, leaning on her elbow, te expression of her face constantly\nchanging with the narrative, watchd Pierre with an attention that never\nwandered--evidently herself expeiencing all that he described. Not only\nher look, but her exclamationsand the brief questions she put, showed\nPierre that she understood jus what he wished to convey. It was clear\nthat she understood not only wat he said but also what he wished to,\nbut could not, express in words The account Pierre gave of the incident\nwith the child and the woman or protecting whom he was arrested was\nthis: \"It was an awful sight--cildren abandoned, some in the flames...\nOne was snatched out before myeyes... and there were women who had\ntheir things snatched off and ther earrings torn out...\" he flushed and\ngrew confused. \"Then a patrol arived and all the men--all those who\nwere not looting, that is--were arested, and I among them.\"\n\n\"I am sure you're not telling us everythin; I am sure you did\nsomething...\" said Natasha and pausing added, \"somthing fine?\"\n\nPierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wantd to pass over\nthe horrible details, but Natasha insisted that he shoud not omit\nanything.\n\nPierre began to tell about Karataev, but paused.By this time he had\nrisen from the table and was pacing the room, Nataha following him with\nher eyes. Then he added:\n\n\"No, you can't understnd what I learned from that illiterate man--that\nsimple fellow.\"\n\n\"Yes yes, go on!\" said Natasha. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"They killed him almost beore my eyes.\"\n\nAnd Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on totell of the last\ndays of their retreat, of Karataev's illness and his eath.\n\nHe told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. Henow, as\nit were, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. Now tha he was\ntelling it all to Natasha he experienced that pleasure which aman has\nwhen women listen to him--not clever women who when listening ither try\nto remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when oportunity\noffers to retell it, or who wish to adopt it to some thought f their\nown and promptly contribute their own clever comments preparedin their\nlittle mental workshop--but the pleasure given by real women ifted with\na capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows o himself.\nNatasha without knowing it was all attention: she did not loe a word,\nno single quiver in Pierre's voice, no look, no twitch of a uscle in\nhis face, nor a single gesture. She caught the unfinished wor in its\nflight and took it straight into her open heart, divining the ecret\nmeaning of all Pierre's mental travail.\n\nPrincess Mary understoo his story and sympathized with him, but she now\nsaw something else tht absorbed all her attention. She saw the\npossibility of love and happness between Natasha and Pierre, and the\nfirst thought of this filled er heart with gladness.\n\nIt was three o'clock in the morning. The footen came in with sad and\nstern faces to change the candles, but no one oticed them.\n\nPierre finished his story. Natasha continued to look at im intently\nwith bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying tounderstand\nsomething more which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre in hamefaced\nand happy confusion glanced occasionally at her, and tried t think what\nto say next to introduce a fresh subject. Princess Mary wa silent. It\noccurred to none of them that it was three o'clock and tim to go to\nbed.\n\n\"People speak of misfortunes and sufferings,\" remarkedPierre, \"but if\nat this moment I were asked: 'Would you rather be whatyou were before\nyou were taken prisoner, or go through all this again? then for\nheaven's sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh! Weimagine\nthat when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost, butit is\nonly then that what is new and good begins. While there is life here is\nhappiness. There is much, much before us. I say this to you,\" e added,\nturning to Natasha.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she said, answering somethin quite different. \"I too should\nwish nothing but to relive it all fromthe beginning.\"\n\nPierre looked intently at her.\n\n\"Yes, and nothing mor,\" said Natasha.\n\n\"It's not true, not true!\" cried Pierre. \"I am not t blame for being\nalive and wishing to live--nor you either.\"\n\nSuddenlyNatasha bent her head, covered her face with her hands, and\nbegan to cy.\n\n\"What is it, Natasha?\" said Princess Mary.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing.\" Sh smiled at Pierre through her tears. \"Good night!\nIt is time for bed.\"\nPierre rose and took his leave.\n\nPrincess Mary and Natasha met as usul in the bedroom. They talked of\nwhat Pierre had told them. Princess Mry did not express her opinion of\nPierre nor did Natasha speak of him.\n\"Well, good night, Mary!\" said Natasha. \"Do you know, I am often afrad\nthat by not speaking of him\" (she meant Prince Andrew) \"for fear of ot\ndoing justice to our feelings, we forget him.\"\n\nPrincess Mary sighe deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of\nNatasha's remark, but he did not express agreement in words.\n\n\"Is it possible to forget?\" sad she.\n\n\"It did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was har and\npainful, but good, very good!\" said Natasha. \"I am sure he reallyloved\nhim. That is why I told him... Was it all right?\" she added, sudenly\nblushing.\n\n\"To tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!\" aid Princess\nMary.\n\n\"Do you know, Mary...\" Natasha suddenly said with  mischievous smile\nsuch as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for  long time, \"he has\nsomehow grown so clean, smooth, and fresh--as if h had just come out of\na Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a mora bath. Isn't it true?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Princess Mary. \"He has greatly mproved.\"\n\n\"With a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, ust as if he\nhad come straight from the bath... Papa used to...\"\n\n\"I uderstand why he\" (Prince Andrew) \"liked no one so much as him,\"\nsaid Pincess Mary.\n\n\"Yes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are frends when they\nare quite different. That must be true. Really he is qute unlike him--\nin everything.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he's wonderful.\"\n\n\"Well, god night,\" said Natasha.\n\nAnd the same mischievous smile lingered for along time on her face as\nif it had been forgotten there.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIt was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night. Hepaced\nup and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult prblem\nand frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing, ad now\nsmiling happily.\n\nHe was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Natasha, nd of their love, at one\nmoment jealous of her past, then reproaching imself for that feeling.\nIt was already six in the morning and he stil paced up and down the\nroom.\n\n\"Well, what's to be done if it cannot beavoided? What's to be done?\nEvidently it has to be so,\" said he to himelf, and hastily undressing\nhe got into bed, happy and agitated but fre from hesitation or\nindecision.\n\n\"Strange and impossible as such happness seems, I must do everything\nthat she and I may be man and wife,\" e told himself.\n\nA few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petrsburg on the\nFriday. When he awoke on the Thursday, Savelich came to sk him about\npacking for the journey.\n\n\"What, to Petersburg? What is Ptersburg? Who is there in Petersburg?\"\nhe asked involuntarily, though nly to himself. \"Oh, yes, long ago\nbefore this happened I did for somereason mean to go to Petersburg,\" he\nreflected. \"Why? But perhaps I shll go. What a good fellow he is and\nhow attentive, and how he remember everything,\" he thought, looking at\nSavelich's old face, \"and what a leasant smile he has!\"\n\n\"Well, Savelich, do you still not wish to accet your freedom?\" Pierre\nasked him.\n\n\"What's the good of freedom to me,your excellency? We lived under the\nlate count--the kingdom of heaven e his!--and we have lived under you\ntoo, without ever being wronged.\"\n\"And your children?\"\n\n\"The children will live just the same. With suchmasters one can live.\"\n\n\"But what about my heirs?\" said Pierre. \"Suppoing I suddenly marry...\nit might happen,\" he added with an involuntarysmile.\n\n\"If I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a goo thing.\"\n\n\"How easy he thinks it,\" thought Pierre. \"He doesn't know ho terrible\nit is and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is terrile!\"\n\n\"So what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?\" asked Saveich.\n\n\"No, I'll put it off for a bit. I'll tell you later. You must fogive\nthe trouble I have put you to,\" said Pierre, and seeing Savelich mile,\nhe thought: \"But how strange it is that he should not know that ow\nthere is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be settled first f\nall! But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending. Shll\nI have a talk with him and see what he thinks?\" Pierre reflected. \"o,\nanother time.\"\n\nAt breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, hat he had been to\nsee Princess Mary the day before and had there met-\"Whom do you think?\nNatasha Rostova!\"\n\nThe princess seemed to see nothng more extraordinary in that than if he\nhad seen Anna Semenovna.\n\n\"Doyou know her?\" asked Pierre.\n\n\"I have seen the princess,\" she replied.\"I heard that they were\narranging a match for her with young Rostov. I would be a very good\nthing for the Rostovs, they are said to be uttery ruined.\"\n\n\"No; I mean do you know Natasha Rostova?\"\n\n\"I heard about hat affair of hers at the time. It was a great pity.\"\n\n\"No, she eitherdoesn't understand or is pretending,\" thought Pierre.\n\"Better not say nything to her either.\"\n\nThe princess too had prepared provisions for ierre's journey.\n\n\"How kind they all are,\" thought Pierre. \"What is suprising is that\nthey should trouble about these things now when it canno longer be of\ninterest to them. And all for me!\"\n\nOn the same day th Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him to send\na representativeto the Faceted Palace to recover things that were to be\nreturned to thir owners that day.\n\n\"And this man too,\" thought Pierre, looking into he face of the Chief\nof Police. \"What a fine, good-looking officer andhow kind. Fancy\nbothering about such trifles now! And they actually sa he is not honest\nand takes bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why should't he take bribes?\nThat's the way he was brought up, and everybody doe it. But what a\nkind, pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at m.\"\n\nPierre went to Princess Mary's to dinner.\n\nAs he drove through thestreets past the houses that had been burned\ndown, he was surprised bythe beauty of those ruins. The picturesqueness\nof the chimney stacks ad tumble-down walls of the burned-out quarters\nof the town, stretchingout and concealing one another, reminded him of\nthe Rhine and the Coloseum. The cabmen he met and their passengers, the\ncarpenters cutting te timber for new houses with axes, the women\nhawkers, and the shopkeeprs, all looked at him with cheerful beaming\neyes that seemed to say: \"h, there he is! Let's see what will come of\nit!\"\n\nAt the entrance to Pincess Mary's house Pierre felt doubtful whether he\nhad really been thre the night before and really seen Natasha and\ntalked to her. \"Perhap I imagined it; perhaps I shall go in and find no\none there.\" But he hd hardly entered the room before he felt her\npresence with his whole bing by the loss of his sense of freedom. She\nwas in the same black dres with soft folds and her hair was done the\nsame way as the day before yet she was quite different. Had she been\nlike this when he entered te day before he could not for a moment have\nfailed to recognize her.\n\nhe was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince\nAnrew's fiancee. A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on\nhe face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression.\n\nPierre dined wth them and would have spent the whole evening there, but\nPrincess Mar was going to vespers and Pierre left the house with her.\n\nNext day hecame early, dined, and stayed the whole evening. Though\nPrincess Mary nd Natasha were evidently glad to see their visitor and\nthough all Piere's interest was now centered in that house, by the\nevening they had alked over everything and the conversation passed from\none trivial topc to another and repeatedly broke off. He stayed so long\nthat PrincessMary and Natasha exchanged glances, evidently wondering\nwhen he would o. Pierre noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy\nand embarrasse, but sat on because he simply could not get up and take\nhis leave.\n\nPincess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and complaining ofa headache began to say good night.\n\n\"So you are going to Petersburg tmorrow?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, I am not going,\" Pierre replied hastily, in  surprised tone and as\nthough offended. \"Yes... no... to Petersburg? Tmorrow--but I won't say\ngood-by yet. I will call round in case you hav any commissions for me,\"\nsaid he, standing before Princess Mary and trning red, but not taking\nhis departure.\n\nNatasha gave him her hand an went out. Princess Mary on the other hand\ninstead of going away sank nto an armchair, and looked sternly and\nintently at him with her deep,radiant eyes. The weariness she had\nplainly shown before had now quitepassed off. With a deep and long-\ndrawn sigh she seemed to be preparedfor a lengthy talk.\n\nWhen Natasha left the room Pierre's confusion andawkwardness\nimmediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement He quickly\nmoved an armchair toward Princess Mary.\n\n\"Yes, I wanted totell you,\" said he, answering her look as if she had\nspoken. \"Princess help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess, my\ndear friend, liste! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of her, I\nknow it's impossibleto speak of it now. But I want to be a brother to\nher. No, not that, Idon't, I can't...\"\n\nHe paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hads.\n\n\"Well,\" he went on with an evident effort at self-control and cohrence.\n\"I don't know when I began to love her, but I have loved her an her\nalone all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine life wthout\nher. I cannot propose to her at present, but the thought that pehaps\nshe might someday be my wife and that I may be missing that\npossiility... that possibility... is terrible. Tell me, can I hope?\nTell mewhat I am to do, dear princess!\" he added after a pause, and\ntouched hr hand as she did not reply.\n\n\"I am thinking of what you have told me, answered Princess Mary. \"This\nis what I will say. You are right that o speak to her of love at\npresent...\"\n\nPrincess Mary stopped. She was oing to say that to speak of love was\nimpossible, but she stopped becase she had seen by the sudden change in\nNatasha two days before that se would not only not be hurt if Pierre\nspoke of his love, but that it as the very thing she wished for.\n\n\"To speak to her now wouldn't do,\" aid the princess all the same.\n\n\"But what am I to do?\"\n\n\"Leave it to m,\" said Princess Mary. \"I know...\"\n\nPierre was looking into Princess Mry's eyes.\n\n\"Well?... Well?...\" he said.\n\n\"I know that she loves... wil love you,\" Princess Mary corrected\nherself.\n\nBefore her words were ot, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened\nexpression seized Princes Mary's hand.\n\n\"What makes you think so? You think I may hope? You thnk...?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so,\" said Princess Mary with a smile. \"Write toher\nparents, and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish itto\nhappen and my heart tells me it will.\"\n\n\"No, it cannot be! How happ I am! But it can't be.... How happy I am!\nNo, it can't be!\" Pierre ket saying as he kissed Princess Mary's hands.\n\n\"Go to Petersburg, that ill be best. And I will write to you,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"To Petersburg? Go tere? Very well, I'll go. But I may come again\ntomorrow?\"\n\nNext day Piere came to say good-by. Natasha was less animated than she\nhad been th day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre\nsometimes felt asif he was vanishing and that neither he nor she\nexisted any longer, tht nothing existed but happiness. \"Is it possible?\nNo, it can't be,\" hetold himself at every look, gesture, and word that\nfilled his soul wit joy.\n\nWhen on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he couldnot help\nholding it a little longer in his own.\n\n\"Is it possible that his hand, that face, those eyes, all this treasure\nof feminine charm s strange to me now, is it possible that it will one\nday be mine foreve, as familiar to me as I am to myself?... No, that's\nimpossible!...\"\n\nGood-bye, Count,\" she said aloud. \"I shall look forward very much to\nyur return,\" she added in a whisper.\n\nAnd these simple words, her look,and the expression on her face which\naccompanied them, formed for two onths the subject of inexhaustible\nmemories, interpretations, and happ meditations for Pierre. \"'I shall\nlook forward very much to your retun....' Yes, yes, how did she say it?\nYes, 'I shall look forward very mch to your return.' Oh, how happy I\nam! What is happening to me? How hppy I am!\" said Pierre to himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nThere was nothing n Pierre's soul now at all like what had troubled it\nduring his courtsip of Helene.\n\nHe did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling o shame the words\nhe had spoken, or say: \"Oh, why did I not say that?\" nd, \"Whatever made\nme say 'Je vous aime'?\" On the contrary, he now repated in imagination\nevery word that he or Natasha had spoken and pictued every detail of\nher face and smile, and did not wish to diminish oradd anything, but\nonly to repeat it again and again. There was now nota shadow of doubt\nin his mind as to whether what he had undertaken wasright or wrong.\nOnly one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind: \"Wsn't it all a\ndream? Isn't Princess Mary mistaken? Am I not too conceied and self-\nconfident? I believe all this--and suddenly Princess Marywill tell her,\nand she will be sure to smile and say: 'How strange! Hemust be deluding\nhimself. Doesn't he know that he is a man, just a man while I...? I am\nsomething altogether different and higher.'\"\n\nThat ws the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not now make any\nplans The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only\nhe cold attain it, it would be the end of all things. Everything ended\nwiththat.\n\nA joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself inapable,\npossessed him. The whole meaning of life--not for him alone bu for the\nwhole world--seemed to him centered in his love and the possiility of\nbeing loved by her. At times everybody seemed to him to be ocupied with\none thing only--his future happiness. Sometimes it seemed t him that\nother people were all as pleased as he was himself and merel tried to\nhide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other intersts. In\nevery word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness. He oten\nsurprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smileswhich\nseemed to express a secret understanding between him and them. Ad when\nhe realized that people might not be aware of his happiness, hepitied\nthem with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain o them\nthat all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworth of\nattention.\n\nWhen it was suggested to him that he should enter the ivil service, or\nwhen the war or any general political affairs were dicussed on the\nassumption that everybody's welfare depended on this or hat issue of\nevents, he would listen with a mild and pitying smile andsurprise\npeople by his strange comments. But at this time he saw everyody--both\nthose who, as he imagined, understood the real meaning of lie (that is,\nwhat he was feeling) and those unfortunates who evidently id not\nunderstand it--in the bright light of the emotion that shone wihin\nhimself, and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met\neveything that was good and worthy of being loved.\n\nWhen dealing with theaffairs and papers of his dead wife, her memory\naroused in him no feelng but pity that she had not known the bliss he\nnow knew. Prince Vasil, who having obtained a new post and some fresh\ndecorations was particlarly proud at this time, seemed to him a\npathetic, kindly old man muc to be pitied.\n\nOften in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blisful insanity. All\nthe views he formed of men and circumstances at thistime remained true\nfor him always. He not only did not renounce them sbsequently, but when\nhe was in doubt or inwardly at variance, he refered to the views he had\nheld at this time of his madness and they alway proved correct.\n\n\"I may have appeared strange and queer then,\" he thoght, \"but I was not\nso mad as I seemed. On the contrary I was then wisr and had more\ninsight than at any other time, and understood all thatis worth\nunderstanding in life, because... because I was happy.\"\n\nPiere's insanity consisted in not waiting, as he used to do, to\ndiscover prsonal attributes which he termed \"good qualities\" in people\nbefore loing them; his heart was now overflowing with love, and by\nloving peopl without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving\nthem.\n\n\n\n\nCAPTER XX\n\nAfter Pierre's departure that first evening, when Natasha ha said to\nPrincess Mary with a gaily mocking smile: \"He looks just, yes just as\nif he had come out of a Russian bath--in a short coat and wit his hair\ncropped,\" something hidden and unknown to herself, but irrepessible,\nawoke in Natasha's soul.\n\nEverything: her face, walk, look, ad voice, was suddenly altered. To\nher own surprise a power of life andhope of happiness rose to the\nsurface and demanded satisfaction. From hat evening she seemed to have\nforgotten all that had happened to her.She no longer complained of her\nposition, did not say a word about thepast, and no longer feared to\nmake happy plans for the future. She spoe little of Pierre, but when\nPrincess Mary mentioned him a long-extingished light once more kindled\nin her eyes and her lips curved with a srange smile.\n\n\nThe change that took place in Natasha at first surprise Princess Mary;\nbut when she understood its meaning it grieved her. \"Cn she have loved\nmy brother so little as to be able to forget him so son?\" she thought\nwhen she reflected on the change. But when she was wih Natasha she was\nnot vexed with her and did not reproach her. The reaakened power of\nlife that had seized Natasha was so evidently irrepresible and\nunexpected by her that in her presence Princess Mary felt tha she had\nno right to reproach her even in her heart.\n\nNatasha gave herelf up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that\nshe did not try t hide the fact that she was no longer sad, but bright\nand cheerful.\n\nWen Princess Mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with\nPirre, Natasha met her on the threshold.\n\n\"He has spoken? Yes? He has spken?\" she repeated.\n\nAnd a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemedto beg forgiveness for\nher joy settled on Natasha's face.\n\n\"I wanted t listen at the door, but I knew you would tell me.\"\n\nUnderstandable an touching as the look with which Natasha gazed at her\nseemed to Princes Mary, and sorry as she was to see her agitation,\nthese words pained er for a moment. She remembered her brother and his\nlove.\n\n\"But what'sto be done? She can't help it,\" thought the princess.\n\nAnd with a sad nd rather stern look she told Natasha all that Pierre\nhad said. On heaing that he was going to Petersburg Natasha was\nastounded.\n\n\"To Petersurg!\" she repeated as if unable to understand.\n\nBut noticing the grievd expression on Princess Mary's face she guessed\nthe reason of that saness and suddenly began to cry.\n\n\"Mary,\" said she, \"tell me what I shold do! I am afraid of being bad.\nWhatever you tell me, I will do. Tellme....\"\n\n\"You love him?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" whispered Natasha.\n\n\"Then why are youcrying? I am happy for your sake,\" said Princess Mary,\nwho because of hose tears quite forgave Natasha's joy.\n\n\"It won't be just yet--someda. Think what fun it will be when I am his\nwife and you marry Nicholas!\n\n\"Natasha, I have asked you not to speak of that. Let us talk about yu.\"\n\nThey were silent awhile.\n\n\"But why go to Petersburg?\" Natasha sudenly asked, and hastily replied\nto her own question. \"But no, no, he mst... Yes, Mary, He must....\"\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE: 1813 - 20\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\nSeven years had passed. The storm-tossed sea of European history had\nubsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. But the\nmystrious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of\ntheir otion are unknown to us) continued to operate.\n\nThough the surface of he sea of history seemed motionless, the movement\nof humanity went on s unceasingly as the flow of time. Various groups\nof people formed anddissolved, the coming formation and dissolution of\nkingdoms and displaement of peoples was in course of preparation.\n\nThe sea of history wasnot driven spasmodically from shore to shore as\npreviously. It was seehing in its depths. Historic figures were not\nborne by the waves from ne shore to another as before. They now seemed\nto rotate on one spot. he historical figures at the head of armies, who\nformerly reflected th movement of the masses by ordering wars,\ncampaigns, and battles, now eflected the restless movement by political\nand diplomatic combination, laws, and treaties.\n\nThe historians call this activity of the historcal figures \"the\nreaction.\"\n\nIn dealing with this period they sternly ondemn the historical\npersonages who, in their opinion, caused what thy describe as the\nreaction. All the well-known people of that period, rom Alexander and\nNapoleon to Madame de Stael, Photius, Schelling, Ficte, Chateaubriand,\nand the rest, pass before their stern judgment seatand are acquitted or\ncondemned according to whether they conduced to pogress or to reaction.\n\nAccording to their accounts a reaction took plce at that time in Russia\nalso, and the chief culprit was Alexander I,the same man who according\nto them was the chief cause of the liberal ovement at the commencement\nof his reign, being the savior of Russia.\nThere is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy essayist to\nearned historian, who does not throw his little stone at Alexander forthings he did wrong at this period of his reign.\n\n\"He ought to have aced in this way and in that way. In this case he did\nwell and in that cse badly. He behaved admirably at the beginning of\nhis reign and durin 1812, but acted badly by giving a constitution to\nPoland, forming theHoly Alliance, entrusting power to Arakcheev,\nfavoring Golitsyn and myticism, and afterwards Shishkov and Photius. He\nalso acted badly by cocerning himself with the active army and\ndisbanding the Semenov regimet.\"\n\nIt would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the\nhstorians address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good for\numanity.\n\nWhat do these reproaches mean?\n\nDo not the very actions for hich the historians praise Alexander I (the\nliberal attempts at the beinning of his reign, his struggle with\nNapoleon, the firmness he displyed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813)\nflow from the same sources--the ircumstances of his birth, education,\nand life--that made his personalty what it was and from which the\nactions for which they blame him (th Holy Alliance, the restoration of\nPoland, and the reaction of 1820 an later) also flowed?\n\nIn what does the substance of those reproaches le?\n\nIt lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I,\nsanding on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the\nblindig light of history focused upon him; a character exposed to those\nstrogest of all influences: the intrigues, flattery, and self-deception\nineparable from power; a character who at every moment of his life felt\n responsibility for all that was happening in Europe; and not a\nfictitous but a live character who like every man had his personal\nhabits, pssions, and impulses toward goodness, beauty, and truth--that\nthis chaacter--though not lacking in virtue (the historians do not\naccuse him f that)--had not the same conception of the welfare of\nhumanity fifty ears ago as a present-day professor who from his youth\nupwards has bee occupied with learning: that is, with books and\nlectures and with takng notes from them.\n\nBut even if we assume that fifty years ago Alexaner I was mistaken in\nhis view of what was good for the people, we mustinevitably assume that\nthe historian who judges Alexander will also afer the lapse of some\ntime turn out to be mistaken in his view of what s good for humanity.\nThis assumption is all the more natural and ineviable because, watching\nthe movement of history, we see that every yearand with each new\nwriter, opinion as to what is good for mankind changs; so that what\nonce seemed good, ten years later seems bad, and vice ersa. And what is\nmore, we find at one and the same time quite contradctory views as to\nwhat is bad and what is good in history: some peopleregard giving a\nconstitution to Poland and forming the Holy Alliance a praiseworthy in\nAlexander, while others regard it as blameworthy.\n\nTh activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called useful or\nharmfl, for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful.\nIf tat activity displeases somebody, this is only because it does not\nagre with his limited understanding of what is good. Whether the\npreservaton of my father's house in Moscow, or the glory of the Russian\narms, o the prosperity of the Petersburg and other universities, or the\nfreedm of Poland or the greatness of Russia, or the balance of power in\nEurpe, or a certain kind of European culture called \"progress\" appear\nto e to be good or bad, I must admit that besides these things the\nactionof every historic character has other more general purposes\ninaccessibe to me.\n\nBut let us assume that what is called science can harmonize ll\ncontradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and badby\nwhich to try historic characters and events; let us say that Alexaner\ncould have done everything differently; let us say that with guidane\nfrom those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim ofthe\nmovement of humanity, he might have arranged matters according to he\nprogram his present accusers would have given him--of nationality,\nreedom, equality, and progress (these, I think, cover the ground). Letus assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated,and that Alexander had acted on it. What would then have become of theactivity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in\nhe government--an activity that in the opinion of the historians was\ngod and beneficent? Their activity would not have existed: there would\nave been no life, there would have been nothing.\n\nIf we admit that humn life can be ruled by reason, the possibility of\nlife is destroyed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIf we assume as the historians do that great men lead huanity to the\nattainment of certain ends--the greatness of Russia or ofFrance, the\nbalance of power in Europe, the diffusion of the ideas of he\nRevolution, general progress, or anything else--then it is impossibe to\nexplain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions f\nchance and genius.\n\nIf the aim of the European wars at the beginningof the nineteenth\ncentury had been the aggrandizement of Russia, that im might have been\naccomplished without all the preceding wars and witout the invasion. If\nthe aim was the aggrandizement of France, that miht have been attained\nwithout the Revolution and without the Empire. I the aim was the\ndissemination of ideas, the printing press could haveaccomplished that\nmuch better than warfare. If the aim was the progres of civilization,\nit is easy to see that there are other ways of diffuing civilization\nmore expedient than by the destruction of wealth and f human lives.\n\nWhy did it happen in this and not in some other way?\n\necause it happened so! \"Chance created the situation; genius utilized\nt,\" says history.\n\nBut what is chance? What is genius?\n\nThe words chane and genius do not denote any really existing thing and\ntherefore canot be defined. Those words only denote a certain stage of\nunderstandin of phenomena. I do not know why a certain event occurs; I\nthink that  cannot know it; so I do not try to know it and I talk about\nchance. Isee a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary\nhuman agences; I do not understand why this occurs and I talk of\ngenius.\n\nTo a hed of rams, the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a\nspecial encosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others\nmust seem tobe a genius. And it must appear an astonishing conjunction\nof genius wth a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram,\nwho instead f getting into the general fold every evening goes into a\nspecial enclsure where there are oats--that this very ram, swelling\nwith fat, is klled for meat.\n\nBut the rams need only cease to suppose that all that appens to them\nhappens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aim; they need only\nadmit that what happens to them may also have purpose beyond their ken,\nand they will at once perceive a unity and coherenc in what happened to\nthe ram that was fattened. Even if they do not knw for what purpose\nthey are fattened, they will at least know that allthat happened to the\nram did not happen accidentally, and will no longr need the conceptions\nof chance or genius.\n\nOnly by renouncing our clim to discern a purpose immediately\nintelligible to us, and admitting he ultimate purpose to be beyond our\nken, may we discern the sequence f experiences in the lives of historic\ncharacters and perceive the caue of the effect they produce\n(incommensurable with ordinary human capailities), and then the words\nchance and genius become superfluous.\n\nWeneed only confess that we do not know the purpose of the European\nconvlsions and that we know only the facts--that is, the murders, first\ninFrance, then in Italy, in Africa, in Prussia, in Austria, in Spain,\nan in Russia--and that the movements from the west to the east and from\nhe east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events, and\not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius inNapoleon and Alexander, but we shall be unable to consider them to be\nnything but like other men, and we shall not be obliged to have\nrecoure to chance for an explanation of those small events which made\nthese eople what they were, but it will be clear that all those small\neventswere inevitable.\n\nBy discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate prpose, we shall\nclearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blosom or seed for\nany single plant better suited to it than those it prouces, so it is\nimpossible to imagine any two people more completely adpted down to the\nsmallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill, han Napoleon and\nAlexander with all their antecedents.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\nThe fundamental and essential significance of the European events of he\nbeginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mas of\nthe European peoples from west to east and afterwards from east towest.\nThe commencement of that movement was the movement from west to ast.\nFor the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike moveent to\nMoscow it was necessary: (1) that they should form themselves ito a\nmilitary group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlke\nmilitary group of the east, (2) that they should abandon all establshed\ntraditions and customs, and (3) that during their military movemet they\nshould have at their head a man who could justify to himself an to them\nthe deceptions, robberies, and murders which would have to becommitted\nduring that movement.\n\nAnd beginning with the French Revoluton the old inadequately large\ngroup was destroyed, as well as the old abits and traditions, and step\nby step a group was formed of larger diensions with new customs and\ntraditions, and a man was produced who wold stand at the head of the\ncoming movement and bear the responsibilit for all that had to be done.\n\nA man without convictions, without habis, without traditions, without a\nname, and not even a Frenchman, emergs--by what seem the strangest\nchances--from among all the seething Frech parties, and without joining\nany one of them is borne forward to a rominent position.\n\nThe ignorance of his colleagues, the weakness and nsignificance of his\nopponents, the frankness of his falsehoods, and te dazzling and self-\nconfident limitations of this man raise him to th head of the army. The\nbrilliant qualities of the soldiers of the armysent to Italy, his\nopponents' reluctance to fight, and his own childis audacity and self-\nconfidence secure him military fame. Innumerable s-called chances\naccompany him everywhere. The disfavor into which he flls with the\nrulers of France turns to his advantage. His attempts to void his\npredestined path are unsuccessful: he is not received into th Russian\nservice, and the appointment he seeks in Turkey comes to nothng. During\nthe war in Italy he is several times on the verge of destrution and\neach time is saved in an unexpected manner. Owing to various iplomatic\nconsiderations the Russian armies--just those which might hae destroyed\nhis prestige--do not appear upon the scene till he is no lnger there.\n\nOn his return from Italy he finds the government in Parisin a process\nof dissolution in which all those who are in it are ineviably wiped out\nand destroyed. And by chance an escape from this dangerus position\npresents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless exedition to\nAfrica. Again so-called chance accompanies him. ImpregnableMalta\nsurrenders without a shot; his most reckless schemes are crownedwith\nsuccess. The enemy's fleet, which subsequently did not let a singe boat\npass, allows his entire army to elude it. In Africa a whole seres of\noutrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants. Ad the\nmen who commit these crimes, especially their leader, assure theselves\nthat this is admirable, this is glory--it resembles Caesar and lexander\nthe Great and is therefore good.\n\nThis ideal of glory and gradeur--which consists not merely in\nconsidering nothing wrong that one oes but in priding oneself on every\ncrime one commits, ascribing to itan incomprehensible supernatural\nsignificance--that ideal, destined toguide this man and his associates,\nhad scope for its development in Afica. Whatever he does succeeds. The\nplague does not touch him. The crulty of murdering prisoners is not\nimputed to him as a fault. His childshly rash, uncalled-for, and\nignoble departure from Africa, leaving hi comrades in distress, is set\ndown to his credit, and again the enemy' fleet twice lets him slip\npast. When, intoxicated by the crimes he ha committed so successfully,\nhe reaches Paris, the dissolution of the rpublican government, which a\nyear earlier might have ruined him, has rached its extreme limit, and\nhis presence there now as a newcomer freefrom party entanglements can\nonly serve to exalt him--and though he hiself has no plan, he is quite\nready for his new role.\n\nHe had no plan,he was afraid of everything, but the parties snatched at\nhim and demaned his participation.\n\nHe alone--with his ideal of glory and grandeur eveloped in Italy and\nEgypt, his insane self-adulation, his boldness i crime and frankness in\nlying--he alone could justify what had to be dne.\n\nHe is needed for the place that awaits him, and so almost apart fom his\nwill and despite his indecision, his lack of a plan, and all hi\nmistakes, he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power an\nthe conspiracy is crowned with success.\n\nHe is pushed into a meeting f the legislature. In alarm he wishes to\nflee, considering himself los. He pretends to fall into a swoon and\nsays senseless things that shoud have ruined him. But the once proud\nand shrewd rulers of France, feeing that their part is played out, are\neven more bewildered than he, ad do not say the words they should have\nsaid to destroy him and retaintheir power.\n\nChance, millions of chances, give him power, and all menas if by\nagreement co-operate to confirm that power. Chance forms the haracters\nof the rulers of France, who submit to him; chance forms thecharacter\nof Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government; chance cotrives a\nplot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirm his\npower. Chance puts the Duc d'Enghien in his hands and unexpectedl\ncauses him to kill him--thereby convincing the mob more forcibly thanin\nany other way that he had the right, since he had the might. Chancecontrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an\nexpediton against England (which would inevitably have ruined him) he\nnever crries out that intention, but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and\nthe Ausrians, who surrender without a battle. Chance and genius give\nhim the ictory at Austerlitz; and by chance all men, not only the\nFrench but al Europe--except England which does not take part in the\nevents about o happen--despite their former horror and detestation of\nhis crimes, nw recognize his authority, the title he has given himself,\nand his idel of grandeur and glory, which seems excellent and\nreasonable to them ll.\n\nAs if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement,the\nwestern forces push toward the east several times in 1805, 1806, 107,\nand 1809, gaining strength and growing. In 1811 the group of peopl that\nhad formed in France unites into one group with the peoples of Cntral\nEurope. The strength of the justification of the man who stands t the\nhead of the movement grows with the increased size of the group.During\nthe ten-year preparatory period this man had formed relations wth all\nthe crowned heads of Europe. The discredited rulers of the worl can\noppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate Napoleonic ideal of gory\nand grandeur. One after another they hasten to display their\ninsigificance before him. The King of Prussia sends his wife to seek\nthe grat man's mercy; the Emperor of Austria considers it a favor that\nthis an receives a daughter of the Caesars into his bed; the Pope, the\nguarian of all that the nations hold sacred, utilizes religion for the\naggandizement of the great man. It is not Napoleon who prepares himself\nfr the accomplishment of his role, so much as all those round him who\npepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is\nhappning and has to happen. There is no step, no crime or petty fraud\nhe cmmits, which in the mouths of those around him is not at once\nrepresened as a great deed. The most suitable fete the Germans can\ndevise for im is a celebration of Jena and Auerstadt. Not only is he\ngreat, but s are his ancestors, his brothers, his stepsons, and his\nbrothers-in-la. Everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his\nreason and t prepare him for his terrible part. And when he is ready so\ntoo are th forces.\n\nThe invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal--Mosow. That\ncity is taken; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than te opposing\narmies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz to Waram. But\nsuddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitheto had so\nconsistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successesto the\npredestined goal, an innumerable sequence of inverse chances ocur--from\nthe cold in his head at Borodino to the sparks which set Moscw on fire,\nand the frosts--and instead of genius, stupidity and immeasrable\nbaseness become evident.\n\nThe invaders flee, turn back, flee agan, and all the chances are now\nnot for Napoleon but always against him\n\nA countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a\nremakable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east.\nAttemptd drives from east to west--similar to the contrary movements of\n1805,1807, and 1809--precede the great westward movement; there is the\nsamecoalescence into a group of enormous dimensions; the same adhesion\nof he people of Central Europe to the movement; the same hesitation\nmidwa, and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached.\n\nParis, he ultimate goal, is reached. The Napoleonic government and army\nare dstroyed. Napoleon himself is no longer of any account; all his\nactionsare evidently pitiful and mean, but again an inexplicable chance\noccur. The allies detest Napoleon whom they regard as the cause of\ntheir suferings. Deprived of power and authority, his crimes and his\ncraft expsed, he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten\nyears previosly and one year later--an outlawed brigand. But by some\nstrange chanc no one perceives this. His part is not yet ended. The man\nwho ten yeas before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand\nis sent t an island two days' sail from France, which for some reason\nis presened to him as his dominion, and guards are given to him and\nmillions ofmoney are paid him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe flood of nations begins to subide into its normal channels. The\nwaves of the great movement abate, ad on the calm surface eddies are\nformed in which float the diplomatist, who imagine that they have\ncaused the floods to abate.\n\nBut the smooh sea again suddenly becomes disturbed. The diplomatists\nthink that thir disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure of\nnatural force; they anticipate war between their sovereigns; the\nposition seems to hem insoluble. But the wave they feel to be rising\ndoes not come from he quarter they expect. It rises again from the same\npoint as before--aris. The last backwash of the movement from the west\noccurs: a backwah which serves to solve the apparently insuperable\ndiplomatic difficulies and ends the military movement of that period of\nhistory.\n\nThe manwho had devastated France returns to France alone, without any\nconspircy and without soldiers. Any guard might arrest him, but by\nstrange chnce no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they\ncursed the dy before and will curse again a month later.\n\nThis man is still neededto justify the final collective act.\n\nThat act is performed.\n\nThe lastrole is played. The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his\npowderand paint: he will not be wanted any more.\n\nAnd some years pass duringwhich he plays a pitiful comedy to himself in\nsolitude on his island, ustifying his actions by intrigues and lies\nwhen the justification is o longer needed, and displaying to the whole\nworld what it was that peple had mistaken for strength as long as an\nunseen hand directed his ations.\n\nThe manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped te actor\nshows him to us.\n\n\"See what you believed in! This is he! Do yo now see that it was not he\nbut I who moved you?\"\n\nBut dazed by the foce of the movement, it was long before people\nunderstood this.\n\nStill reater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of\nAlexander I,the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from\neast to west\n\nWhat was needed for him who, overshadowing others, stood at the headof\nthat movement from east to west?\n\nWhat was needed was a sense of jutice and a sympathy with European\naffairs, but a remote sympathy not dlled by petty interests; a moral\nsuperiority over those sovereigns of he day who co-operated with him; a\nmild and attractive personality; an a personal grievance against\nNapoleon. And all this was found in Alexnder I; all this had been\nprepared by innumerable so-called chances inhis life: his education,\nhis early liberalism, the advisers who surrouded him, and by\nAusterlitz, and Tilsit, and Erfurt.\n\nDuring the nationl war he was inactive because he was not needed. But\nas soon as the neessity for a general European war presented itself he\nappeared in his lace at the given moment and, uniting the nations of\nEurope, led them o the goal.\n\nThe goal is reached. After the final war of 1815 Alexande possesses all\npossible power. How does he use it?\n\nAlexander I--the pcifier of Europe, the man who from his early years\nhad striven only fo his people's welfare, the originator of the liberal\ninnovations in hi fatherland--now that he seemed to possess the utmost\npower and therefre to have the possibility of bringing about the\nwelfare of his people--at the time when Napoleon in exile was drawing\nup childish and mendaious plans of how he would have made mankind happy\nhad he retained powr--Alexander I, having fulfilled his mission and\nfeeling the hand of Gd upon him, suddenly recognizes the insignificance\nof that supposed poer, turns away from it, and gives it into the hands\nof contemptible me whom he despises, saying only:\n\n\"Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Ty Name!... I too am a man like the\nrest of you. Let me live like a manand think of my soul and of God.\"\n\nAs the sun and each atom of ether i a sphere complete in itself, and\nyet at the same time only a part of  whole too immense for man to\ncomprehend, so each individual has withi himself his own aims and yet\nhas them to serve a general purpose incoprehensible to man.\n\nA bee settling on a flower has stung a child. Andthe child is afraid of\nbees and declares that bees exist to sting peope. A poet admires the\nbee sucking from the chalice of a flower and say it exists to suck the\nfragrance of flowers. A beekeeper, seeing the be collect pollen from\nflowers and carry it to the hive, says that it eists to gather honey.\nAnother beekeeper who has studied the life of th hive more closely says\nthat the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the yung bees and rear a\nqueen, and that it exists to perpetuate its race.  botanist notices\nthat the bee flying with the pollen of a male flowerto a pistil\nfertilizes the latter, and sees in this the purpose of thebee's\nexistence. Another, observing the migration of plants, notices tat the\nbee helps in this work, and may say that in this lies the purpoe of the\nbee. But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by he first,\nthe second, or any of the processes the human mind can discen. The\nhigher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purpses, the\nmore obvious it becomes, that the ultimate purpose is beyond ur\ncomprehension.\n\nAll that is accessible to man is the relation of th life of the bee to\nother manifestations of life. And so it is with th purpose of historic\ncharacters and nations.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nNatasha's edding to Bezukhov, which took place in 1813, was the last\nhappy eventin the family of the old Rostovs. Count Ilya Rostov died\nthat same yea and, as always happens, after the father's death the\nfamily group broe up.\n\nThe events of the previous year: the burning of Moscow and the light\nfrom it, the death of Prince Andrew, Natasha's despair, Petya's eath,\nand the old countess' grief fell blow after blow on the old coun's\nhead. He seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all theseevents, and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting an\ninviting further blows which would finish him. He seemed now frightend\nand distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising.\n\nThe arangements for Natasha's marriage occupied him for a while. He\nordereddinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful, but\nhis cherfulness was not infectious as it used to be: on the contrary it\nevokd the compassion of those who knew and liked him.\n\nWhen Pierre and hiswife had left, he grew very quiet and began to\ncomplain of depression.A few days later he fell ill and took to his\nbed. He realized from thefirst that he would not get up again, despite\nthe doctor's encouragemet. The countess passed a fortnight in an\narmchair by his pillow withou undressing. Every time she gave him his\nmedicine he sobbed and silenty kissed her hand. On his last day,\nsobbing, he asked her and his abset son to forgive him for having\ndissipated their property--that being he chief fault of which he was\nconscious. After receiving communion an unction he quietly died; and\nnext day a throng of acquaintances who cme to pay their last respects\nto the deceased filled the house rented y the Rostovs. All these\nacquaintances, who had so often dined and daned at his house and had so\noften laughed at him, now said, with a commn feeling of self-reproach\nand emotion, as if justifying themselves: \"ell, whatever he may have\nbeen he was a most worthy man. You don't mee such men nowadays.... And\nwhich of us has not weaknesses of his own?\"\nIt was just when the count's affairs had become so involved that it ws\nimpossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that heunexpectedly died.\n\nNicholas was with the Russian army in Paris when te news of his\nfather's death reached him. He at once resigned his commssion, and\nwithout waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absenceand went to\nMoscow. The state of the count's affairs became quite obvius a month\nafter his death, surprising everyone by the immense total o small debts\nthe existence of which no one had suspected. The debts amunted to\ndouble the value of the property.\n\nFriends and relations advied Nicholas to decline the inheritance. But\nhe regarded such a refusalas a slur on his father's memory, which he\nheld sacred, and therefore ould not hear of refusing and accepted the\ninheritance together with te obligation to pay the debts.\n\nThe creditors who had so long been silnt, restrained by a vague but\npowerful influence exerted on them whilehe lived by the count's\ncareless good nature, all proceeded to enforcetheir claims at once. As\nalways happens in such cases rivalry sprang u as to which should get\npaid first, and those who like Mitenka held prmissory notes given them\nas presents now became the most exacting of te creditors. Nicholas was\nallowed no respite and no peace, and those wo had seemed to pity the\nold man--the cause of their losses (if they wre losses)--now\nremorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntariy undertaken the\ndebts and was obviously not guilty of contracting the.\n\nNot one of the plans Nicholas tried succeeded; the estate was sold y\nauction for half its value, and half the debts still remained unpaid\nNicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his brother-i-\nlaw Bezukhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due for valuereceived. And to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder, as the\ncredtors threatened, he re-entered the government service.\n\nHe could not rjoin the army where he would have been made colonel at\nthe next vacanc, for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on\nlife; and so despte his reluctance to remain in Moscow among people who\nhad known him bfore, and despite his abhorrence of the civil service,\nhe accepted a pst in Moscow in that service, doffed the uniform of\nwhich he was so fod, and moved with his mother and Sonya to a small\nhouse on the SivtsevVrazhek.\n\nNatasha and Pierre were living in Petersburg at the time andhad no\nclear idea of Nicholas' circumstances. Having borrowed money frm his\nbrother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition frm him.\nHis position was the more difficult because with his salary of welve\nhundred rubles he had not only to keep himself, his mother, and onya,\nbut had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty. Th\ncountess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions he\nhad been used to from childhood and, unable to realize how hard it as\nfor her son, kept demanding now a carriage (which they did not keep to\nsend for a friend, now some expensive article of food for herself,or\nwine for her son, or money to buy a present as a surprise for Natasa or\nSonya, or for Nicholas himself.\n\nSonya kept house, attended on he aunt, read to her, put up with her\nwhims and secret ill-will, and heled Nicholas to conceal their poverty\nfrom the old countess. Nicholas flt himself irredeemably indebted to\nSonya for all she was doing for hi mother and greatly admired her\npatience and devotion, but tried to kep aloof from her.\n\nHe seemed in his heart to reproach her for being to perfect, and\nbecause there was nothing to reproach her with. She had ll that people\nare valued for, but little that could have made him lov her. He felt\nthat the more he valued her the less he loved her. He ha taken her at\nher word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now bhaved as if all\nthat had passed between them had been long forgotten ad could never in\nany case be renewed.\n\nNicholas' position became worseand worse. The idea of putting something\naside out of his salary prove a dream. Not only did he not save\nanything, but to comply with his moher's demands he even incurred some\nsmall debts. He could see no way ot of this situation. The idea of\nmarrying some rich woman, which was sggested to him by his female\nrelations, was repugnant to him. The othe way out--his mother's death--\nnever entered his head. He wished for nthing and hoped for nothing, and\ndeep in his heart experienced a gloom and stern satisfaction in an\nuncomplaining endurance of his position.He tried to avoid his old\nacquaintances with their commiseration and ofensive offers of\nassistance; he avoided all distraction and recreatio, and even at home\ndid nothing but play cards with his mother, pace siently up and down\nthe room, and smoke one pipe after another. He seeme carefully to\ncherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabld him to endure\nhis position.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAt the beginning of wintr Princess Mary came to Moscow. From reports\ncurrent in town she learnd how the Rostovs were situated, and how \"the\nson has sacrificed himsef for his mother,\" as people were saying.\n\n\"I never expected anything lse of him,\" said Princess Mary to herself,\nfeeling a joyous sense of er love for him. Remembering her friendly\nrelations with all the Rostos which had made her almost a member of the\nfamily, she thought it herduty to go to see them. But remembering her\nrelations with Nicholas inVoronezh she was shy about doing so. Making a\ngreat effort she did howver go to call on them a few weeks after her\narrival in Moscow.\n\nNichoas was the first to meet her, as the countess' room could only be\nreaced through his. But instead of being greeted with pleasure as she\nhad xpected, at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold, stiff,\nprud expression she had not seen on it before. He inquired about her\nheath, led the way to his mother, and having sat there for five minutes\nlft the room.\n\nWhen the princess came out of the countess' room Nichola met her again,\nand with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied he to the anteroom.\nTo her remarks about his mother's health he made no eply. \"What's that\nto you? Leave me in peace,\" his looks seemed to say\n\n\"Why does she come prowling here? What does she want? I can't bear tese\nladies and all these civilities!\" said he aloud in Sonya's presenc,\nevidently unable to repress his vexation, after the princess' carriae\nhad disappeared.\n\n\"Oh, Nicholas, how can you talk like that?\" cried onya, hardly able to\nconceal her delight. \"She is so kind and Mamma isso fond of her!\"\n\nNicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking o the princess any\nmore. But after her visit the old countess spoke of er several times a\nday.\n\nShe sang her praises, insisted that her son mst call on her, expressed\na wish to see her often, but yet always becae ill-humored when she\nbegan to talk about her.\n\nNicholas tried to kee silence when his mother spoke of the princess,\nbut his silence irritaed her.\n\n\"She is a very admirable and excellent young woman,\" said she \"and you\nmust go and call on her. You would at least be seeing someboy, and I\nthink it must be dull for you only seeing us.\"\n\n\"But I don't n the least want to, Mamma.\"\n\n\"You used to want to, and now you don't.Really I don't understand you,\nmy dear. One day you are dull, and the ext you refuse to see anyone.\"\n\n\"But I never said I was dull.\"\n\n\"Why, ou said yourself you don't want even to see her. She is a very\nadmirabe young woman and you always liked her, but now suddenly you\nhave got ome notion or other in your head. You hide everything from\nme.\"\n\n\"Not t all, Mamma.\"\n\n\"If I were asking you to do something disagreeable now-but I only ask\nyou to return a call. One would think mere politeness equired it....\nWell, I have asked you, and now I won't interfere any mre since you\nhave secrets from your mother.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I'll go if ou wish it.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter to me. I only wish it for your sake.\"\nNicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid out the cards for a\npatiece, trying to divert his mother's attention to another topic.\n\nThe sam conversation was repeated next day and the day after, and the\nday aftr that.\n\nAfter her visit to the Rostovs and her unexpectedly chilly reeption by\nNicholas, Princess Mary confessed to herself that she had ben right in\nnot wishing to be the first to call.\n\n\"I expected nothing ese,\" she told herself, calling her pride to her\naid. \"I have nothing t do with him and I only wanted to see the old\nlady, who was always kin to me and to whom I am under many\nobligations.\"\n\nBut she could not paify herself with these reflections; a feeling akin\nto remorse troubledher when she thought of her visit. Though she had\nfirmly resolved not o call on the Rostovs again and to forget the whole\nmatter, she felt hrself all the time in an awkward position. And when\nshe asked herself hat distressed her, she had to admit that it was her\nrelation to Rosto. His cold, polite manner did not express his feeling\nfor her (she kne that) but it concealed something, and until she could\ndiscover what tat something was, she felt that she could not be at\nease.\n\nOne day in idwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her\nnephew's lessns, she was informed that Rostov had called. With a firm\nresolution no to betray herself and not show her agitation, she sent\nfor Mademoisele Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room.\n\nHer first glance a Nicholas' face told her that he had only come to\nfulfill the demands f politeness, and she firmly resolved to maintain\nthe tone in which headdressed her.\n\nThey spoke of the countess' health, of their mutual frends, of the\nlatest war news, and when the ten minutes required by proriety had\nelapsed after which a visitor may rise, Nicholas got up to sy good-by.\n\nWith Mademoiselle Bourienne's help the princess had maintaned the\nconversation very well, but at the very last moment, just whenhe rose,\nshe was so tired of talking of what did not interest her, andher mind\nwas so full of the question why she alone was granted so litte\nhappiness in life, that in a fit of absent-mindedness she sat still,her\nluminous eyes gazing fixedly before her, not noticing that he had isen.\n\nNicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice he\nabstraction, made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then agai\nlooked at the princess. She still sat motionless with a look of\nsuffeing on her gentle face. He suddenly felt sorry for her and was\nvaguelyconscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face\nexpressed He wished to help her and say something pleasant, but could\nthink of othing to say.\n\n\"Good-bye, Princess!\" said he.\n\nShe started, flushed, nd sighed deeply.\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon,\" she said as if waking up. Are you going\nalready, Count? Well then, good-by! Oh, but the cushion or the\ncountess!\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, I'll fetch it,\" said Mademoiselle Burienne, and she\nleft the room.\n\nThey both sat silent, with an occasioal glance at one another.\n\n\"Yes, Princess,\" said Nicholas at last witha sad smile, \"it doesn't\nseem long ago since we first met at Bogucharoo, but how much water has\nflowed since then! In what distress we all semed to be then, yet I\nwould give much to bring back that time... but here's no bringing it\nback.\"\n\nPrincess Mary gazed intently into his eys with her own luminous ones as\nhe said this. She seemed to be trying o fathom the hidden meaning of\nhis words which would explain his feelig for her.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said she, \"but you have no reason to regret th past, Count.\nAs I understand your present life, I think you will alwas recall it\nwith satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that fills i now...\"\n\n\"I cannot accept your praise,\" he interrupted her hurriedly.\"On the\ncontrary I continually reproach myself.... But this is not at ll an\ninteresting or cheerful subject.\"\n\nHis face again resumed its fomer stiff and cold expression. But the\nprincess had caught a glimpse o the man she had known and loved, and it\nwas to him that she now spoke\n\n\"I thought you would allow me to tell you this,\" she said. \"I had coe\nso near to you... and to all your family that I thought you would no\nconsider my sympathy misplaced, but I was mistaken,\" and suddenly hervoice trembled. \"I don't know why,\" she continued, recovering herself,\"but you used to be different, and...\"\n\n\"There are a thousand reasons hy,\" laying special emphasis on the why.\n\"Thank you, Princess,\" he addd softly. \"Sometimes it is hard.\"\n\n\"So that's why! That's why!\" a voic whispered in Princess Mary's soul.\n\"No, it was not only that gay, kin, and frank look, not only that\nhandsome exterior, that I loved in him I divined his noble, resolute,\nself-sacrificing spirit too,\" she saidto herself. \"Yes, he is poor now\nand I am rich.... Yes, that's the onl reason.... Yes, were it not for\nthat...\" And remembering his former tnderness, and looking now at his\nkind, sorrowful face, she suddenly unerstood the cause of his coldness.\n\n\"But why, Count, why?\" she almost ried, unconsciously moving closer to\nhim. \"Why? Tell me. You must tellme!\"\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\"I don't understand your why, Count,\" she contined, \"but it's hard for\nme... I confess it. For some reason you wish todeprive me of our former\nfriendship. And that hurts me.\" There were ters in her eyes and in her\nvoice. \"I have had so little happiness in lie that every loss is hard\nfor me to bear.... Excuse me, good-by!\" and uddenly she began to cry\nand was hurrying from the room.\n\n\"Princess, fr God's sake!\" he exclaimed, trying to stop her.\n\"Princess!\"\n\nShe turnd round. For a few seconds they gazed silently into one\nanother's eyes-and what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly\nbecame possible, ievitable, and very near.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nIn the winter of 1813 Nichols married Princess Mary and moved to Bald\nHills with his wife, his moter, and Sonya.\n\nWithin four years he had paid off all his remaining dets without\nselling any of his wife's property, and having received a sall\ninheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to Pierre aswell.\n\nIn another three years, by 1820, he had so managed his affairs hat he\nwas able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was negtiating\nto buy back Otradnoe--that being his pet dream.\n\nHaving starte farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted to it\nthat it became is favorite and almost his sole occupation. Nicholas was\na plain farme: he did not like innovations, especially the English ones\nthen cominginto vogue. He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate\nmanagement, isliked factories, the raising of expensive products, and\nthe buying o expensive seed corn, and did not make a hobby of any\nparticular part f the work on his estate. He always had before his\nmind's eye the estae as a whole and not any particular part of it. The\nchief thing in hiseyes was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen\nin the air, nor anures, nor special plows, but that most important\nagent by which nitrgen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made effective--\nthe peasant labore. When Nicholas first began farming and began to\nunderstand its differnt branches, it was the serf who especially\nattracted his attention. Te peasant seemed to him not merely a tool,\nbut also a judge of farmingand an end in himself. At first he watched\nthe serfs, trying to undersand their aims and what they considered good\nand bad, and only pretendd to direct them and give orders while in\nreality learning from them teir methods, their manner of speech, and\ntheir judgment of what was god and bad. Only when he had understood the\npeasants' tastes and aspiraions, had learned to talk their language, to\ngrasp the hidden meaning f their words, and felt akin to them did he\nbegin boldly to manage hisserfs, that is, to perform toward them the\nduties demanded of him. AndNicholas' management produced very brilliant\nresults.\n\nGuided by some ift of insight, on taking up the management of the\nestates he at once nerringly appointed as bailiff, village elder, and\ndelegate, the very en the serfs would themselves have chosen had they\nhad the right to chose, and these posts never changed hands. Before\nanalyzing the propertes of manure, before entering into the debit and\ncredit (as he ironicaly called it), he found out how many cattle the\npeasants had and incresed the number by all possible means. He kept the\npeasant families togther in the largest groups possible, not allowing\nthe family groups todivide into separate households. He was hard alike\non the lazy, the deraved, and the weak, and tried to get them expelled\nfrom the commune.\nHe was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants' hay and\ncrn as of his own, and few landowners had their crops sown and\nharveste so early and so well, or got so good a return, as did\nNicholas.\n\nHe dsliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs--the \"drones\"\nas e called them--and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity. When\nadecision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf, especially if one\nad to be punished, he always felt undecided and consulted everybody inthe house; but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripte\ninstead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation. He\nnver felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants. He knew that hisevery decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions.\nHe did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man, or to\nake things easy for or reward anyone, merely because he felt inclined\no do so. He could not have said by what standard he judged what he\nshold or should not do, but the standard was quite firm and definite in\nhs own mind.\n\nOften, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregulaity, he would\nsay: \"What can one do with our Russian peasants?\" and imgined that he\ncould not bear them.\n\nYet he loved \"our Russian peasants and their way of life with his whole\nsoul, and for that very reason hd understood and assimilated the one\nway and manner of farming which poduced good results.\n\nCountess Mary was jealous of this passion of herhusband's and regretted\nthat she could not share it; but she could notunderstand the joys and\nvexations he derived from that world, to her s remote and alien. She\ncould not understand why he was so particularlyanimated and happy when,\nafter getting up at daybreak and spending thewhole morning in the\nfields or on the threshing floor, he returned fro the sowing or mowing\nor reaping to have tea with her. She did not undrstand why he spoke\nwith such admiration and delight of the farming ofthe thrifty and well-\nto-do peasant Matthew Ermishin, who with his famly had carted corn all\nnight; or of the fact that his (Nicholas') sheaes were already stacked\nbefore anyone else had his harvest in. She didnot understand why he\nstepped out from the window to the veranda and siled under his mustache\nand winked so joyfully, when warm steady rain egan to fall on the dry\nand thirsty shoots of the young oats, or why wen the wind carried away\na threatening cloud during the hay harvest hewould return from the\nbarn, flushed, sunburned, and perspiring, with asmell of wormwood and\ngentian in his hair and, gleefully rubbing his hnds, would say: \"Well,\none more day and my grain and the peasants' wil all be under cover.\"\n\nStill less did she understand why he, kindheartd and always ready to\nanticipate her wishes, should become almost desprate when she brought\nhim a petition from some peasant men or women wh had appealed to her to\nbe excused some work; why he, that kind Nichols, should obstinately\nrefuse her, angrily asking her not to interfere n what was not her\nbusiness. She felt he had a world apart, which he lved passionately and\nwhich had laws she had not fathomed.\n\nSometimes wen, trying to understand him, she spoke of the good work he\nwas doing or his serfs, he would be vexed and reply: \"Not in the least;\nit neverentered my head and I wouldn't do that for their good! That's\nall poety and old wives' talk--all that doing good to one's neighbor!\nWhat I wnt is that our children should not have to go begging. I must\nput our ffairs in order while I am alive, that's all. And to do that,\norder an strictness are essential.... That's all about it!\" said he,\nclenchinghis vigorous fist. \"And fairness, of course,\" he added, \"for\nif the pesant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse, he\ncan do n good either for himself or for me.\"\n\nAnd all Nicholas did was fruitfu--probably just because he refused to\nallow himself to think that he ws doing good to others for virtue's\nsake. His means increased rapidly;serfs from neighboring estates came\nto beg him to buy them, and long ater his death the memory of his\nadministration was devoutly preserved mong the serfs. \"He was a\nmaster... the peasants' affairs first and thn his own. Of course he was\nnot to be trifled with either--in a word, e was a real master!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOne matter connected with his anagement sometimes worried Nicholas, and\nthat was his quick temper toether with his old hussar habit of making\nfree use of his fists. At fist he saw nothing reprehensible in this,\nbut in the second year of hismarriage his view of that form of\npunishment suddenly changed.\n\nOnce i summer he had sent for the village elder from Bogucharovo, a man\nwho ad succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused of\ndishonety and various irregularities. Nicholas went out into the porch\nto quetion him, and immediately after the elder had given a few replies\nthe ound of cries and blows were heard. On returning to lunch Nicholas\nwen up to his wife, who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery\nfrme, and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that\nmorning Among other things he spoke of the Bogucharovo elder. Countess\nMary trned red and then pale, but continued to sit with head bowed and\nlips ompressed and gave her husband no reply.\n\n\"Such an insolent scoundrel! he cried, growing hot again at the mere\nrecollection of him. \"If he hd told me he was drunk and did not see...\nBut what is the matter with ou, Mary?\" he suddenly asked.\n\nCountess Mary raised her head and triedto speak, but hastily looked\ndown again and her lips puckered.\n\n\"Why, hatever is the matter, my dearest?\"\n\nThe looks of the plain Countess Mry always improved when she was in\ntears. She never cried from pain orvexation, but always from sorrow or\npity, and when she wept her radian eyes acquired an irresistible charm.\n\nThe moment Nicholas took her had she could no longer restrain herself\nand began to cry.\n\n\"Nicholas, Isaw it... he was to blame, but why do you... Nicholas!\" and\nshe covere her face with her hands.\n\nNicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, eft her side, and paced up\nand down the room. He understood what she ws weeping about, but could\nnot in his heart at once agree with her tha what he had regarded from\nchildhood as quite an everyday event was wrng. \"Is it just\nsentimentality, old wives' tales, or is she right?\" heasked himself.\nBefore he had solved that point he glanced again at herface filled with\nlove and pain, and he suddenly realized that she was ight and that he\nhad long been sinning against himself.\n\n\"Mary,\" he sad softly, going up to her, \"it will never happen again; I\ngive you my ord. Never,\" he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy\nasking for fogiveness.\n\nThe tears flowed faster still from the countess' eyes. She ook his hand\nand kissed it.\n\n\"Nicholas, when did you break your cameo? she asked to change the\nsubject, looking at his finger on which he woe a ring with a cameo of\nLaocoon's head.\n\n\"Today--it was the same affar. Oh, Mary, don't remind me of it!\" and\nagain he flushed. \"I give youmy word of honor it shan't occur again,\nand let this always be a reminer to me,\" and he pointed to the broken\nring.\n\nAfter that, when in disussions with his village elders or stewards the\nblood rushed to his fae and his fists began to clench, Nicholas would\nturn the broken ring o his finger and would drop his eyes before the\nman who was making him ngry. But he did forget himself once or twice\nwithin a twelvemonth, an then he would go and confess to his wife, and\nwould again promise tha this should really be the very last time.\n\n\"Mary, you must despise me\" he would say. \"I deserve it.\"\n\n\"You should go, go away at once, if yu don't feel strong enough to\ncontrol yourself,\" she would reply sadly trying to comfort her husband.\n\nAmong the gentry of the province Nichlas was respected but not liked.\nHe did not concern himself with the iterests of his own class, and\nconsequently some thought him proud and thers thought him stupid. The\nwhole summer, from spring sowing to harvst, he was busy with the work\non his farm. In autumn he gave himself u to hunting with the same\nbusiness-like seriousness--leaving home for  month, or even two, with\nhis hunt. In winter he visited his other vilages or spent his time\nreading. The books he read were chiefly historial, and on these he\nspent a certain sum every year. He was collecting,as he said, a serious\nlibrary, and he made it a rule to read through al the books he bought.\nHe would sit in his study with a grave air, reaing--a task he first\nimposed upon himself as a duty, but which afterwads became a habit\naffording him a special kind of pleasure and a conscousness of being\noccupied with serious matters. In winter, except for usiness\nexcursions, he spent most of his time at home making himself oe with\nhis family and entering into all the details of his children's elations\nwith their mother. The harmony between him and his wife grew loser and\ncloser and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in er.\n\nFrom the time of his marriage Sonya had lived in his house. Befor that,\nNicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself nd\nSonya, blaming himself and commending her. He had asked Princess May to\nbe gentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly realized the wrog he\nhad done Sonya, felt herself to blame toward her, and imagined tht her\nwealth had influenced Nicholas' choice. She could not find faultwith\nSonya in any way and tried to be fond of her, but often felt ill-ill\ntoward her which she could not overcome.\n\nOnce she had a talk withher friend Natasha about Sonya and about her\nown injustice toward her.\n\"You know,\" said Natasha, \"you have read the Gospels a great deal--thre\nis a passage in them that just fits Sonya.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked CountessMary, surprised.\n\n\"'To him that hath shall be given, and from him thathath not shall be\ntaken away.' You remember? She is one that hath not;why, I don't know.\nPerhaps she lacks egotism, I don't know, but from hr is taken away, and\neverything has been taken away. Sometimes I am dradfully sorry for her.\nFormerly I very much wanted Nicholas to marry hr, but I always had a\nsort of presentiment that it would not come off.She is a sterile\nflower, you know--like some strawberry blossoms. Someimes I am sorry\nfor her, and sometimes I think she doesn't feel it as ou or I would.\"\n\nThough Countess Mary told Natasha that those words inthe Gospel must be\nunderstood differently, yet looking at Sonya she ageed with Natasha's\nexplanation. It really seemed that Sonya did not fel her position\ntrying, and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a terile flower.\nShe seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of he family as a\nwhole. Like a cat, she had attached herself not to the eople but to the\nhome. She waited on the old countess, petted and spoied the children,\nwas always ready to render the small services for whih she had a gift,\nand all this was unconsciously accepted from her wit insufficient\ngratitude.\n\nThe country seat at Bald Hills had been rebult, though not on the same\nscale as under the old prince.\n\nThe buildins, begun under straitened circumstances, were more than\nsimple. The imense house on the old stone foundations was of wood,\nplastered only inide. It had bare deal floors and was furnished with\nvery simple hard sfas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made by their own\nserf carpenters ot of their own birchwood. The house was spacious and\nhad rooms for thehouse serfs and apartments for visitors. Whole\nfamilies of the Rostovs and Bolkonskis' relations sometimes came to\nBald Hills with sixteen hrses and dozens of servants and stayed for\nmonths. Besides that, four imes a year, on the name days and birthdays\nof the hosts, as many as ahundred visitors would gather there for a day\nor two. The rest of the ear life pursued its unbroken routine with its\nordinary occupations, ad its breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and suppers,\nprovided out of the poduce of the estate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nIt was the eve of St. Nicholas, te fifth of December, 1820. Natasha had\nbeen staying at her brother's wth her husband and children since early\nautumn. Pierre had gone to Petrsburg on business of his own for three\nweeks as he said, but had remaned there nearly seven weeks and was\nexpected back every minute.\n\nBesies the Bezukhov family, Nicholas' old friend the retired General\nVasil Dmitrich Denisov was staying with the Rostovs this fifth of\nDecember.\nOn the sixth, which was his name day when the house would be full of\nisitors, Nicholas knew he would have to exchange his Tartar tunic for \ntail coat, and put on narrow boots with pointed toes, and drive to th\nnew church he had built, and then receive visitors who would come to\nongratulate him, offer them refreshments, and talk about the electionsof the nobility; but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve o\nthat day in his usual way. He examined the bailiff's accounts of the\nillage in Ryazan which belonged to his wife's nephew, wrote two\nbusines letters, and walked over to the granaries, cattle yards and\nstables efore dinner. Having taken precautions against the general\ndrunkennessto be expected on the morrow because it was a great saint's\nday, he reurned to dinner, and without having time for a private talk\nwith his wfe sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons, at\nwhich the whle household had assembled. At that table were his mother,\nhis mother' old lady companion Belova, his wife, their three children\nwith their overness and tutor, his wife's nephew with his tutor, Sonya,\nDenisov, atasha, her three children, their governess, and old Michael\nIvanovich the late prince's architect, who was living on in retirement\nat Bald ills.\n\nCountess Mary sat at the other end of the table. When her husbad took\nhis place she concluded, from the rapid manner in which after tking up\nhis table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass staning\nbefore him, that he was out of humor, as was sometimes the case whn he\ncame in to dinner straight from the farm--especially before the sup.\nCountess Mary well knew that mood of his, and when she herself wasin a\ngood frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and thn\nbegan to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for is\nill-humor. But today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he shold\nbe angry with her without any reason, and she felt unhappy. She askd\nhim where he had been. He replied. She again inquired whether everyting\nwas going well on the farm. Her unnatural tone made him wince\nunplasantly and he replied hastily.\n\n\"Then I'm not mistaken,\" thought Couness Mary. \"Why is he cross with\nme?\" She concluded from his tone that e was vexed with her and wished\nto end the conversation. She knew her emarks sounded unnatural, but\ncould not refrain from asking some more uestions.\n\nThanks to Denisov the conversation at table soon became genral and\nlively, and she did not talk to her husband. When they left th table\nand went as usual to thank the old countess, Countess Mary heldout her\nhand and kissed her husband, and asked him why he was angry wih her.\n\n\"You always have such strange fancies! I didn't even think of eing\nangry,\" he replied.\n\nBut the word always seemed to her to imply: Yes, I am angry but I won't\ntell you why.\"\n\nNicholas and his wife live together so happily that even Sonya and the\nold countess, who felt jelous and would have liked them to disagree,\ncould find nothing to reprach them with; but even they had their\nmoments of antagonism. Occasionlly, and it was always just after they\nhad been happiest together, the suddenly had a feeling of estrangement\nand hostility, which occurred ost frequently during Countess Mary's\npregnancies, and this was such atime.\n\n\"Well, messieurs et mesdames,\" said Nicholas loudly and with aparent\ncheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpoe to\nvex her), \"I have been on my feet since six this morning. Tomorro I\nshall have to suffer, so today I'll go and rest.\"\n\nAnd without a wod to his wife he went to the little sitting room and\nlay down on the sfa.\n\n\"That's always the way,\" thought Countess Mary. \"He talks to everone\nexcept me. I see... I see that I am repulsive to him, especially wen I\nam in this condition.\" She looked down at her expanded figure andin the\nglass at her pale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes nowlooked\nlarger than ever.\n\nAnd everything annoyed her--Denisov's shoutig and laughter, Natasha's\ntalk, and especially a quick glance Sonya gae her.\n\nSonya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for feelng\nirritated.\n\nHaving sat awhile with her visitors without understandig anything of\nwhat they were saying, she softly left the room and wentto the nursery.\n\nThe children were playing at \"going to Moscow\" in a crriage made of\nchairs and invited her to go with them. She sat down an played with\nthem a little, but the thought of her husband and his unrasonable\ncrossness worried her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe withdifficulty, went to the small sitting room.\n\n\"Perhaps he is not asleep I'll have an explanation with him,\" she said\nto herself. Little Andre, her eldest boy, imitating his mother,\nfollowed her on tiptoe. She di not notice him.\n\n\"Mary, dear, I think he is asleep--he was so tired,\"said Sonya, meeting\nher in the large sitting room (it seemed to Countes Mary that she\ncrossed her path everywhere). \"Andrew may wake him.\"\n\nountess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, felt that\nonya was right, and for that very reason flushed and with evident\ndiffculty refrained from saying something harsh. She made no reply, but\ntoavoid obeying Sonya beckoned to Andrew to follow her quietly and went\no the door. Sonya went away by another door. From the room in which\nNiholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing, every\nslightet tone of which was familiar to his wife. As she listened to it\nshe sa before her his smooth handsome forehead, his mustache, and his\nwhole ace, as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night\nwhen heslept. Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat. And at\nthat momnt little Andrew shouted from outside the door: \"Papa! Mamma's\nstandin here!\" Countess Mary turned pale with fright and made signs to\nthe bo. He grew silent, and quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to\nCountess ary. She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through\nthe doorshe heard Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and\nhis voie said crossly:\n\n\"I can't get a moment's peace.... Mary, is that you? hy did you bring\nhim here?\"\n\n\"I only came in to look and did not notic... forgive me...\"\n\nNicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary mved away from the\ndoor and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minues later little\nblack-eyed three-year-old Natasha, her father's pet, hving learned from\nher brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in th sitting room, ran\nto her father unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyd little girl boldly\nopened the creaking door, went up to the sofa wit energetic steps of\nher sturdy little legs, and having examined the poition of her father,\nwho was asleep with his back to her, rose on tipte and kissed the hand\nwhich lay under his head. Nicholas turned with atender smile on his\nface.\n\n\"Natasha, Natasha!\" came Countess Mary's frghtened whisper from the\ndoor. \"Papa wants to sleep.\"\n\n\"No, Mamma, he oesn't want to sleep,\" said little Natasha with\nconviction. \"He's lauging.\"\n\nNicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took his daughter in his ams.\n\n\"Come in, Mary,\" he said to his wife.\n\nShe went in and sat down b her husband.\n\n\"I did not notice him following me,\" she said timidly. I just looked\nin.\"\n\nHolding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas glaced at his wife and,\nseeing her guilty expression, put his other arm aound her and kissed\nher hair.\n\n\"May I kiss Mamma?\" he asked Natasha.\n\natasha smiled bashfully.\n\n\"Again!\" she commanded, pointing with a pereptory gesture to the spot\nwhere Nicholas had placed the kiss.\n\n\"I don' know why you think I am cross,\" said Nicholas, replying to the\nquestin he knew was in his wife's mind.\n\n\"You have no idea how unhappy, how onely, I feel when you are like\nthat. It always seems to me...\"\n\n\"Mary don't talk nonsense. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\" he\nsaid galy.\n\n\"It seems to be that you can't love me, that I am so plain... alwys...\nand now... in this cond...\"\n\n\"Oh, how absurd you are! It is not eauty that endears, it's love that\nmakes us see beauty. It is only Malinas and women of that kind who are\nloved for their beauty. But do I lve my wife? I don't love her, but...\nI don't know how to put it. Withot you, or when something comes between\nus like this, I seem lost and cn't do anything. Now do I love my\nfinger? I don't love it, but just tr to cut it off!\"\n\n\"I'm not like that myself, but I understand. So you'e not angry with\nme?\"\n\n\"Awfully angry!\" he said, smiling and getting u. And smoothing his hair\nhe began to pace the room.\n\n\"Do you know, Mar, what I've been thinking?\" he began, immediately\nthinking aloud in hi wife's presence now that they had made it up.\n\nHe did not ask if she as ready to listen to him. He did not care. A\nthought had occurred to im and so it belonged to her also. And he told\nher of his intention topersuade Pierre to stay with them till spring.\n\nCountess Mary listenedtill he had finished, made some remark, and in\nher turn began thinkingaloud. Her thoughts were about the children.\n\n\"You can see the woman i her already,\" she said in French, pointing to\nlittle Natasha. \"You reroach us women with being illogical. Here is our\nlogic. I say: 'Papa wnts to sleep!' but she says, 'No, he's laughing.'\nAnd she was right,\" aid Countess Mary with a happy smile.\n\n\"Yes, yes.\" And Nicholas, takin his little daughter in his strong hand,\nlifted her high, placed her o his shoulder, held her by the legs, and\npaced the room with her. Ther was an expression of carefree happiness\non the faces of both father ad daughter.\n\n\"But you know you may be unfair. You are too fond of thisone,\" his wife\nwhispered in French.\n\n\"Yes, but what am I to do?... I ty not to show...\"\n\nAt that moment they heard the sound of the door puley and footsteps in\nthe hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived.\n\"Somebody has come.\"\n\n\"I am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see,\" sai Countess Mary and left\nthe room.\n\nIn her absence Nicholas allowed himelf to give his little daughter a\ngallop round the room. Out of breath he took the laughing child quickly\nfrom his shoulder and pressed her o his heart. His capers reminded him\nof dancing, and looking at the chld's round happy little face he\nthought of what she would be like whenhe was an old man, taking her\ninto society and dancing the mazurka wit her as his old father had\ndanced Daniel Cooper with his daughter.\n\n\"I is he, it is he, Nicholas!\" said Countess Mary, re-entering the room\n few minutes later. \"Now our Natasha has come to life. You should haveseen her ecstasy, and how he caught it for having stayed away so long.Well, come along now, quick, quick! It's time you two were parted,\" sh\nadded, looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father.\nNicholas went out holding the child by the hand.\n\nCountess Mary remaind in the sitting room.\n\n\"I should never, never have believed that one ould be so happy,\" she\nwhispered to herself. A smile lit up her face bt at the same time she\nsighed, and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadess as though she felt,\nthrough her happiness, that there is another srt of happiness\nunattainable in this life and of which she involuntariy thought at that\ninstant.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nNatasha had married in the erly spring of 1813, and in 1820 already had\nthree daughters besides a on for whom she had longed and whom she was\nnow nursing. She had grownstouter and broader, so that it was difficult\nto recognize in this robst, motherly woman the slim, lively Natasha of\nformer days. Her featurs were more defined and had a calm, soft, and\nserene expression. In he face there was none of the ever-glowing\nanimation that had formerly brned there and constituted its charm. Now\nher face and body were oftenall that one saw, and her soul was not\nvisible at all. All that struckthe eye was a strong, handsome, and\nfertile woman. The old fire very rrely kindled in her face now. That\nhappened only when, as was the casethat day, her husband returned home,\nor a sick child was convalescent,or when she and Countess Mary spoke of\nPrince Andrew (she never mentioed him to her husband, who she imagined\nwas jealous of Prince Andrew'smemory), or on the rare occasions when\nsomething happened to induce he to sing, a practice she had quite\nabandoned since her marriage. At th rare moments when the old fire did\nkindle in her handsome, fully deveoped body she was even more\nattractive than in former days.\n\nSince ther marriage Natasha and her husband had lived in Moscow, in\nPetersburg,on their estate near Moscow, or with her mother, that is to\nsay, in Niholas' house. The young Countess Bezukhova was not often seen\nin sociey, and those who met her there were not pleased with her and\nfound herneither attractive nor amiable. Not that Natasha liked\nsolitude--she dd not know whether she liked it or not, she even thought\nthat she did ot--but with her pregnancies, her confinements, the\nnursing of her chidren, and sharing every moment of her husband's life,\nshe had demands n her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing\nsociety. All wh had known Natasha before her marriage wondered at the\nchange in her a at something extraordinary. Only the old countess with\nher maternal istinct had realized that all Natasha's outbursts had been\ndue to her ned of children and a husband--as she herself had once\nexclaimed at Otrdnoe not so much in fun as in earnest--and her mother\nwas now surprise at the surprise expressed by those who had never\nunderstood Natasha, nd she kept saying that she had always known that\nNatasha would make a exemplary wife and mother.\n\n\"Only she lets her love of her husband an children overflow all\nbounds,\" said the countess, \"so that it even beomes absurd.\"\n\nNatasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by cleer folk,\nespecially by the French, which says that a girl should not lt herself\ngo when she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments,should be\neven more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarred, and\nshould fascinate her husband as much as she did before he becae her\nhusband. Natasha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her wtchery,\nof which her singing had been an unusually powerful part. She ave it up\njust because it was so powerfully seductive. She took no pais with her\nmanners or with delicacy of speech, or with her toilet, or o show\nherself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes, or to avid\ninconveniencing him by being too exacting. She acted in contradictin to\nall those rules. She felt that the allurements instinct had formely\ntaught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of herhusband, to whom she had from the first moment given herself up\nentirey--that is, with her whole soul, leaving no corner of it hidden\nfrom hm. She felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained by\nthe oetic feelings that had attracted him to her, but by something\nelse--idefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul.\n\nTo fluffout her curls, put on fashionable dresses, and sing romantic\nsongs to ascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn\nherself o attract herself. To adorn herself for others might perhaps\nhave beenagreeable--she did not know--but she had no time at all for\nit. The chef reason for devoting no time either to singing, to dress,\nor to chooing her words was that she really had no time to spare for\nthese thing.\n\nWe know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed ina\nsubject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject so\ntivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one's entire\natention is devoted to it.\n\nThe subject which wholly engrossed Natasha'sattention was her family:\nthat is, her husband whom she had to keep sothat he should belong\nentirely to her and to the home, and the childre whom she had to bear,\nbring into the world, nurse, and bring up.\n\nAndthe deeper she penetrated, not with her mind only but with her whole\nsul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed her, the larger\ndi that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers\napear, so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet\nws unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary.\n\nThere were hen as now conversations and discussions about women's\nrights, the reltions of husband and wife and their freedom and rights,\nthough these temes were not yet termed questions as they are now; but\nthese topics wre not merely uninteresting to Natasha, she positively\ndid not understnd them.\n\nThese questions, then as now, existed only for those who seenothing in\nmarriage but the pleasure married people get from one anothr, that is,\nonly the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significnce, which\nlies in the family.\n\nDiscussions and questions of that kind which are like the question of\nhow to get the greatest gratification rom one's dinner, did not then\nand do not now exist for those for whomthe purpose of a dinner is the\nnourishment it affords; and the purposeof marriage is the family.\n\nIf the purpose of dinner is to nourish thebody, a man who eats two\ndinners at once may perhaps get more enjoymen but will not attain his\npurpose, for his stomach will not digest the wo dinners.\n\nIf the purpose of marriage is the family, the person who ishes to have\nmany wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure,but in that\ncase will not have a family.\n\nIf the purpose of food is norishment and the purpose of marriage is the\nfamily, the whole questionresolves itself into not eating more than one\ncan digest, and not havig more wives or husbands than are needed for\nthe family--that is, one ife or one husband. Natasha needed a husband.\nA husband was given her nd he gave her a family. And she not only saw\nno need of any other or etter husband, but as all the powers of her\nsoul were intent on servin that husband and family, she could not\nimagine and saw no interest inimagining how it would be if things were\ndifferent.\n\nNatasha did not cre for society in general, but prized the more the\nsociety of her relaives--Countess Mary, and her brother, her mother,\nand Sonya. She value the company of those to whom she could come\nstriding disheveled from he nursery in her dressing gown, and with\njoyful face show a yellow intead of a green stain on baby's napkin, and\nfrom whom she could hear rassuring words to the effect that baby was\nmuch better.\n\nTo such an exent had Natasha let herself go that the way she dressed\nand did her har, her ill-chosen words, and her jealousy--she was\njealous of Sonya, o the governess, and of every woman, pretty or plain-\n-were habitual sujects of jest to those about her. The general opinion\nwas that Pierre as under his wife's thumb, which was really true. From\nthe very first ays of their married life Natasha had announced her\ndemands. Pierre wa greatly surprised by his wife's view, to him a\nperfectly novel one, tat every moment of his life belonged to her and\nto the family. His wif's demands astonished him, but they also\nflattered him, and he submittd to them.\n\nPierre's subjection consisted in the fact that he not onlydared not\nflirt with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any otherwoman; did\nnot dare dine at the club as a pastime, did not dare spend oney on a\nwhim, and did not dare absent himself for any length of time except on\nbusiness--in which his wife included his intellectual pursuts, which\nshe did not in the least understand but to which she attribued great\nimportance. To make up for this, at home Pierre had the rightto\nregulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose.At\nhome Natasha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husbad,\nand the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupied--that i,\nwas reading or writing in his study. Pierre had but to show a partiaity\nfor anything to get just what he liked done always. He had only toexpress a wish and Natasha would jump up and run to fulfill it.\n\nThe etire household was governed according to Pierre's supposed orders,\ntha is, by his wishes which Natasha tried to guess. Their way of life\nandplace of residence, their acquaintances and ties, Natasha's\noccupation, the children's upbringing, were all selected not merely\nwith regard o Pierre's expressed wishes, but to what Natasha from the\nthoughts he xpressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be. And she\ndeduced th essentials of his wishes quite correctly, and having once\narrived at hem clung to them tenaciously. When Pierre himself wanted to\nchange hi mind she would fight him with his own weapons.\n\nThus in a time of troble ever memorable to him after the birth of their\nfirst child who wasdelicate, when they had to change the wet nurse\nthree times and Natash fell ill from despair, Pierre one day told her\nof Rousseau's view, wih which he quite agreed, that to have a wet nurse\nis unnatural and harful. When her next baby was born, despite the\nopposition of her mother the doctors, and even of her husband himself--\nwho were all vigorousl opposed to her nursing her baby herself, a thing\nthen unheard of and onsidered injurious--she insisted on having her own\nway, and after tha", "cell_layer_1": [[[[0.8623532652854919, 0.16569262742996216, 0.04290623590350151, 0.9347659945487976,
